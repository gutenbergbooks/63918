FATHER AND SON</h2>


<p>&#8220;So you would rather be an engineer than a
lawyer, Bob? Is that what you want to tell
me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, sir,&mdash;an engineer rather than anything
else!&#8221;</p>

<p>The speakers were sitting on a bench in the
park which surrounds the old Virginia State
House in Richmond. Father and son they were
certainly&mdash;the likeness was unmistakable.</p>

<p>The man hesitated a moment before going on
with the conversation. When he spoke it was
seemingly from a new angle.</p>

<p>&#8220;How old are you now, Bob? Seventeen,
isn&#8217;t it? Yes, yes, of course. And in a week
or two you will have finished with Crossways
for good?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>[10]</span>&#8220;Mr. Moseley says I am ready for my college
exams, Dad. Tells me that he can&#8217;t take
me along any further.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And instead of taking the examinations for
Harvard and then going fishing with me, you
want to go out West and work on an engineering
corps all summer. After that, what?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If you&#8217;ll let me, I want to go to Rensselaer
and study civil engineering. I&#8217;ll have had some
practice then and the theory will come easier.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I see. But, my son, do you realize that if
you follow your desire to be an engineer there
will never be the firm of Robert Hazard and
Son? That the practice I have built up will
not pass on to you as I have so often planned?
We would have made a great team, my boy, and
it&#8217;s rather hard to give up the idea so suddenly.
But I see that you must do as you
wish.&#8221;</p>

<p>This way of taking it was rather disconcerting
to Bob Hazard. He had hoped his
father would be a little angry, perhaps, at the
news of his decision. And if he had, Bob
could have stuck to his determination with more
heart, for he would have felt he had been treated<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11"></a>[11]</span>
a little unjustly. But his father&#8217;s acceptance of
the situation left him without any defense.
Besides, the note of disappointment which was
so evident, convinced him that from his father&#8217;s
standpoint he was ungrateful for the love
and care he had received.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, no, Dad!&#8221; Bob cried. &#8220;We won&#8217;t give
up the idea! I&mdash;didn&#8217;t know you felt that way
about it. The engineering can go. I&#8217;ll write
Whiskers and tell him I&#8217;m not coming. Of
course we&#8217;ll have the firm of Hazard and Son
and we&#8217;ll make rival lawyers sit up and take
notice!&#8221;</p>

<p>The older Hazard looked at his son with
gleaming eyes. What stuff the lad was made
of! An immense pride filled him that this boy
could be so unselfish and destroy his own carefully
laid plans for the future with such a
brave attempt at sincerity.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you, Bob,&#8221; he said slowly. &#8220;But
I can&#8217;t let you give up your ambition for mine.
You would not be happy, nor after a time would
I, for I realize that your desire to be an
engineer is not just a whim. You could not be
a good lawyer unless your heart were in it, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12"></a>[12]</span>
I don&#8217;t want a son of mine to be anything
but a good lawyer, if he&#8217;s one at all. I&#8217;d
far rather have you a good engineer than an
almost good lawyer. You will have to try out
your plan. If it works, well and good; if it
doesn&#8217;t, you can still try something else. You
are old enough to decide for yourself, my
son.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You <i>are</i> a good Dad!&#8221; cried Bob, putting
an arm around the older man&#8217;s shoulders and
hugging him unashamedly. &#8220;Whiskers&mdash;that
is, Steve Whitney&mdash;wrote and told me to
report to him as soon as I could. Then I have
your permission to go West just as soon as
school closes?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; was the quick answer, although the
speaker had hoped that the boy would suggest
spending a week or two with him before he left
for the West. But Bob&#8217;s next words cheered
him a lot.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course, Dad, I don&#8217;t mean to go until
we&#8217;ve had a chance to see each other. If you
could only come out to Crossways for the next
week or two it would be great! That way, we
could visit and still I could get out on the job<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a>[13]</span>
just as soon as possible. I don&#8217;t want Whiskers
to fill my place just because I don&#8217;t show
up. But I&#8217;ll come up to New York&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You won&#8217;t have to do that,&#8221; said Mr. Hazard
with a smile.</p>

<p>&#8220;You mean you can come to Crossways?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I do. It just so happens that I can spare a
few days right now. Besides, I&#8217;d like to meet
the fellows you are always writing about&mdash;Tom
and Ned&mdash;and see the place where you
grew that big crop of corn last summer.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Hazard was as good as his word. The
same night found him installed in the colonial
house from which the great plantation of
Crossways had formerly been managed. Now
the plantation was a thing of memory only.
Only the house and comparatively few cultivated
acres remained of the once proud estate.
Edward Moseley, the last of a long line, kept
a school, which, primarily started for the benefit
of his tenants&#8217; children, had become so famous
that boys from all parts of the country were
now enrolled.</p>

<p>The summer before, when Mr. Hazard found
that it was necessary for him to make a trip<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>[14]</span>
abroad, he had left Bob at Crossways; and to
make things pleasanter he had sent down a
canoe, giving it to Tom Wickham and Ned
Moseley, Bob&#8217;s chums. Therefore, when he
appeared in person, Tom and Ned were prepared
to like him. They were not disappointed.</p>

<p>When he demanded it the boys showed him
the island in the low grounds on which they
had grown the test crop of corn.</p>

<p>&#8220;It seems to me that you fellows hit on a
really excellent plan to occupy your time during
the summer. Who thought of it?&#8221; he asked
after examining the plot.</p>

<p>&#8220;Tom,&#8221; said Ned quickly. &#8220;He planned it
and we did the work.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I reckon I did my share of the work too,&#8221;
exploded Tom. When the laugh died down,
Mr. Hazard went on with his questions.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you going to plant it again this year?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not this piece, sir,&#8221; answered Tom. &#8220;I&#8217;ve
got all I can do helping my father. When we
raised more than double the average yield of
his fields on our little patch here, he decided
that there was something in modern farming
methods after all, so this year we&#8217;re putting all<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a>[15]</span>
our corn in as it should be! And we&#8217;re going
to have some crop, too!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Didn&#8217;t you meet Mr. Whitney somewheres
around here, Bob?&#8221; Mr. Hazard asked, turning
to his son.</p>

<p>Before Bob could answer, Tom Wickham
had broken in.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Whitney? Oh, you mean &#8216;Whiskers,&#8217;
who put the engineering bug into Bob&#8217;s head,
last year. We found him up the river at the
cave. Would you like to go up there?&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Hazard assented, so they planned the
expedition for another day, as this afternoon
was growing old. When they went, however,
he was told of the adventures that had centered
around the cave and Whiskers. How
they had come on him by chance and, thinking
him an escaped criminal, had undertaken his
capture. This had led to Ned&#8217;s being caught
instead and when Bob and Tom had effected
the rescue, had resulted in the discovery of the
secret chamber behind the cave. Mr. Hazard
was particularly interested when he heard of
the part Whiskers had taken in the defense of
the island and its precious crop from the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16"></a>[16]</span>
onslaught of the summer freshet. They told
him that it was not until the crop was safe that
Whiskers had revealed who he was, an engineer
in the United States Reclamation Service. He
had hidden himself away until certain
unfounded charges against him were cleared
away. These had been brought by grafters he
had found on the job he had in charge.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, Bob,&#8221; remarked Mr. Hazard when
the tale was done, &#8220;you certainly had a better
time here than you would have had if you had
gone to Russia with me!&#8221;</p>

<p>Finally Bob&#8217;s father had to go back to New
York. Several telegrams had come and the
last one could not be disregarded. The night
before he left Mr. Hazard led Bob out into
the grounds. When they came to the fence,
they leaned on it and started talking. The
moon was up and shed its light on the flat fields.
In the hum of the country stillness, only the
summer whistle of the quail and the sharp
plaintive cry of the whippoorwill were distinct.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are determined, Bob?&#8221; the older man
asked. Bob knew to what his father referred.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, sir! Absolutely!&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17"></a>[17]</span>&#8220;You have counted the cost well? There
is no great reward in what you plan to do.
There will be no limousines&mdash;no luxury in the
life you will lead. A lawyer can have both.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know it, sir!&#8221;</p>

<p>The man knew his was a losing fight yet he
wanted to struggle on. Through the years he
had watched over his motherless boy, he had
dreamed dreams. He had seen the time when
Bob would enter his office, when he would
become a partner and at last when he would
take onto his young shoulders the whole burden
of the work. It had been a good dream and
he was loath to give it up. He made one more
effort.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you find that the work is not as much
fun as you expected, will you come back and
tell me so? You won&#8217;t stick it out just as a
matter of pride?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can safely promise that, Daddy. You
know, don&#8217;t you, that I really would <i>like</i> to be
a lawyer if I only could? But I know I&#8217;ve just
<i>got</i> to try this engineering. If it turns out
wrong for me I&#8217;ll come back gladly.&#8221;</p>

<p>Both were silent for a few minutes. Then<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a>[18]</span>
Bob spoke again, his manner saying more than
his words:</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve been bully to me, Dad.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are all I&#8217;ve got, son,&#8221; was the quiet
reply. &#8220;I must let you do the best you can for
yourself.&#8221;</p>

<p>They went into the house and the next day
Mr. Hazard was whirling northward, gazing
out of the car window and hoping that some
good chance would bring his boy back to him.
As it was he felt lost and quite alone.</p>
<hr class="chap" />

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19"></a>[19]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak"><small>CHAPTER II</small><br />


U. S. R. S.</h2>
</div>

<p>The long trip across the continent proved to
be no hardship for Bob. It was the first time
he had ever gone alone on so long a journey and
he could not help but feel a certain sense of
liberty. He made friends with everybody on
the train and many tired travelers saw the
scenery through his enthusiastic eyes, finding
beauty in what ordinarily would have seemed
to them commonplace.</p>

<p>One thing only served to disturb his perfect
enjoyment: This was a conviction not to be
denied, that his father was hurt by his action.
As he thought over their talks he knew that
underneath the approval his father had given,
lay a deep disappointment. That Bob would
not be a lawyer was a hard blow; the knowledge
that his son&#8217;s choice of an occupation in
life would mean almost constant separation,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20"></a>[20]</span>
must hurt the elder Hazard, who thought the
world of his only son.</p>

<p>Bob realized these things keenly and they
were painful to him, yet he could not bring
himself to give up his plan to be an engineer.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dad made his own way, tackled the job
he wanted and made good. I&#8217;ve <i>got</i> to do the
same. Probably <i>his</i> father wanted him to do
something quite different. I&#8217;ll ask him about
that some time. Besides, if I just took up Dad&#8217;s
business, it wouldn&#8217;t seem right somehow.&#8221;</p>

<p>But thoughts such as these occurred to him
less and less as the distance between him and the
East grew greater. By the time he dropped
off the train at Williams, Arizona, where he
changed to the day coach that would take him
to the Grand Canyon, his mind was so full of
the future that there was no room for the
things he had left behind him.</p>

<p>When the jolting train stopped at the last
station, the boy stepped off almost at Whiskers&#8217;
side. Dropping his suit case, he caught the
hand that was stretched out to him and
was happy when he saw the man&#8217;s grin of
welcome.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21"></a>[21]</span>&#8220;Good work, Bob, my boy! It&#8217;s great to see
you! Have a good trip? You&#8217;ve grown since
I saw you&mdash;how&#8217;re the other fellows? How&#8217;s
Big Chris?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Fine! Fine!&#8221; answered Bob. &#8220;And it&#8217;s
good to see you too. I&#8217;m awfully glad you&#8217;ve
got a place for me. Is the job here at the
Canyon?&#8221;</p>

<p>Steve Whitney shook his head. &#8220;No&mdash;but
I&#8217;ll tell you all about it as we go to the hotel.
Grab your satchel and come along.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Right you are, Whisk&mdash;I mean, Mr. Whitney,&#8221;
Bob answered in some confusion. &#8220;I
suppose you&#8217;ll have to be <i>Mister</i> Whitney now
since you are the Big Boss. Last summer you
were the fellow who was so good to us kids
and we took liberties.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are right, Bob. I am the chief and
starting from to-day I will have to be Mr.
Whitney. There is another rodman here and
it would be bad for discipline if you called me
by that&mdash;&#8216;vacation&#8217; name, let&#8217;s call it. But
we had mighty good times when I was just
Whiskers, didn&#8217;t we?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You bet,&#8221; answered Bob. &#8220;I&#8217;ll never forget<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22"></a>[22]</span>
&#8217;em.&#8221; For a moment he said nothing, letting
his thoughts drift. Then&mdash;&#8220;But where <i>is</i> the
job? You said it wasn&#8217;t here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, just now there isn&#8217;t any job at all&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What?&#8221; exploded the boy, anxiously.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t worry,&#8221; the engineer assured him;
&#8220;there will be plenty of work. I have just finished
a project in Colorado and am waiting for
further orders. I told you to meet me here
because I wanted you to see the greatest natural
wonder we have in the United States, the Grand
Canyon, and I am going to work you so hard
later on that you won&#8217;t have another chance to
get here before you go back to college. And
I want your first sight of it to be at sunset.
Then it is most wonderful.&#8221;</p>

<p>By this time they had reached the hotel.</p>

<p>&#8220;Go and wash up and come down quickly,&#8221;
urged Bob&#8217;s new boss. &#8220;It&#8217;s almost sunset, and
I don&#8217;t want you to miss it! I&#8217;ll wait for you
here on the porch.&#8221;</p>

<p>Bob wasted no time and a few minutes later
joined Mr. Whitney. The veranda of the hotel
is built almost on the edge of the great rift
in the surface of the earth. Bob started to pull<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23"></a>[23]</span>
up a chair to the railing where his friend was
sitting but stopped as the other rose.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve got a better place than this to see it
from,&#8221; said Mr. Whitney. &#8220;A lot of folks will
be coming out here presently and too many
people spoil the thing. Come along.&#8221;</p>

<p>Bob followed and was led to a little clump
of bushes that grew on the edge some distance
from the hotel. Mr. Whitney pushed them
aside and disclosed a little ledge a few feet
down from the rim, which afforded a comfortable
seat.</p>

<p>&#8220;Some class, eh, Bob?&#8221; laughed Whiskers
as they settled themselves. &#8220;I found it and try
to get here every night. But let&#8217;s stop talking;
it&#8217;s about to begin.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was no need to talk; in fact, the
glorious beauty of the panorama spread before
him would have made it almost impossible to
talk even if Bob had wanted to.</p>

<p>As far as the eye could reach, the great chasm
extended. In it rose pinnacles, spires and mountain
ranges, alternating with deep valleys and
gulches. At the very bottom wound a tiny
thread of silver, the Colorado River, for whose<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"></a>[24]</span>
passage nature had undertaken such a gigantic
task and, in its accomplishment, had created
such beauty.</p>

<p>Bob&#8217;s first feeling was of his own littleness,
his unimportance in the face of such magnitude.
But this went away as the sun, dropping
steadily to the opposite horizon, began to paint
the scenes with magic colors.</p>

<p>It was as if the sun were an artist, who,
not satisfied with his efforts, changed and
changed again the colors on his canvas, for each
moment the tints and hues would fade or grow
more intense as the shadows grew deeper, and
the scene would seem quite different.</p>

<p>When at last the sun dropped below the
edge of the distant hills, leaving the Canyon in
deep purple shadow, Bob turned to Mr. Whitney.</p>

<p>&#8220;That is all I can stand now,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It
is too wonderful.&#8221;</p>

<p>He walked back to the hotel, too overcome
by the beauty of the thing he had seen to
attempt talking of it. Evidently Steve Whitney
knew how the boy felt, for he did not break
the silence. But once inside the house Bob realized
that it had been a long time since luncheon.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25"></a>[25]</span>&#8220;When&#8217;s supper, Boss Whitney? I&#8217;m hungry
enough to eat tacks!&#8221;</p>

<p>The man laughed. &#8220;Even the Grand Canyon
can&#8217;t keep a good, healthy appetite down for
long, can it? I guess supper is pretty nearly
ready now. But wait a minute&mdash;here is
someone I want you to know.&#8221;</p>

<p>Bob looked up to see a young fellow of about
his own age coming towards them. He was
rather tall and dark and dressed in khaki, and
wore canvas leggins. It was the costume of a
regular civil engineer, thought the boy from the
East.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is Jerry King, Bob,&#8221; said Whitney.
&#8220;Another member of my corps. Shake hands
with Bob Hazard, Jerry. We will all be
together this summer.&#8221;</p>

<p>The newcomer put out his hand and Bob
grasped it warmly. He was prepared to like
anybody and anything in this new life he had
begun. After a few words they moved off in
the direction of the dining room.</p>

<p>&#8220;What have you been up to this afternoon,
Jerry?&#8221; asked the Chief, when they had found
their table.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26"></a>[26]</span>&#8220;Nothing much,&#8221; was the answer. &#8220;Fooling
&#8217;round the Canyon a little.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You go down into it, then?&#8221; asked Bob.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, there&#8217;s a trail but there&#8217;s nothing much
down there anyway.&#8221; This from Jerry in an
unenthusiastic tone.</p>

<p>The talk went on mostly about the Canyon.
Bob noticed, however, that Jerry King took
very little part in the conversation. He didn&#8217;t
seem exactly unwilling to talk, but his remarks
were few and far between. And when they
came they were short and matter of fact. Mr.
Whitney appeared not to notice this much. It
was rather as if he was used to Jerry&#8217;s manner.
But Bob, however, felt that he was going to
have a hard job in thawing out this chap who
was to be his companion through the summer.
He wanted to make friends but Jerry seemed
to repulse every advance he made.</p>

<p>When supper was over the party went out
on the porch of the hotel. The Chief lit his
pipe and settled into a big rocking chair. &#8220;Well,
Bob,&#8221; he said, &#8220;now that you are here, are you
glad that you came?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You bet I am,&#8221; was the enthusiastic answer.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27"></a>[27]</span>&#8220;But he hasn&#8217;t seen any work yet,&#8221; put in
Jerry shortly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not worried about that,&#8221; Bob said confidently.
&#8220;I think I&#8217;ll like that too.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not all a cinch,&#8221; said Whiskers. &#8220;The
Reclamation Service is a hard taskmaster. Jerry
knows. He has been with me almost a year&mdash;ever
since I came back from Virginia.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was silence for a moment and then
Bob asked quietly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Please, Mr. Whitney, won&#8217;t you tell me
something about the Reclamation Service?
Although I have read what I could, I know
very little about the real spirit of it, only just
figures showing what it&#8217;s done or is going to
do.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right, Bob, I will, but you&#8217;ll have to
stop me if I begin to bore you. The Service
is an enthusiasm of mine, you know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess you know very well I won&#8217;t be bored.
Go ahead.&#8221;</p>

<p>Steve Whitney filled his pipe and then began
a description of what is perhaps the most
important thing the Government has ever done
for the West.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28"></a>[28]</span>&#8220;About twelve years ago,&#8221; he said when his
pipe was well lighted, &#8220;after a great deal of
agitation over it, Congress passed a bill which
created the thing we call the Reclamation
Service. Its object was to increase the number
of farms and to increase the total area of productive
land. As you no doubt know, almost all
the desert land in the United States would be
extremely productive provided it could get a
sufficient supply of one thing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Water?&#8221; put in Bob.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, just that. In other parts of the country
this water is provided by rainfall. But deserts
are deserts only because the rainfall is slight, if
there is any at all. Therefore it is necessary
to build dams in the country where there is
rainfall, collect the water, and send it down
to the desert lands where it is needed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is that what the Service does?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, that is our biggest job. We call it
irrigation. But it isn&#8217;t always necessary to
build these dams where the rainfall is heavy.
If we can dam a river above the point where
it begins to dry up, we can usually collect
enough water during the flood season to supply<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29"></a>[29]</span>
a great area of dry land below it during all
the months of the year.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And has the plan been a success?&#8221; interrupted
Bob again.</p>

<p>&#8220;Decidedly. During 1913 the value of the
crops produced on the lands we have already
irrigated was nearly sixteen million dollars.
If all the land had been worked which we are
now able to irrigate, we would have had nearly
a million and a half acres of productive land
which before was only plains of alkali dust.
The projects already planned and not yet completed,
or in some cases not even started, will
more than double the results I have just told
you about. It is a great work.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But does the Government pay for all this?&#8221;
asked Bob.</p>

<p>&#8220;At first it does, but the plan is that farmers
who use irrigated lands must pay a water tax
which will eventually repay the Government the
amount of money it has invested. On some
projects the farmers have entirely repaid the
Government. On others it will be years before
the money is finally returned.&#8221;</p>

<p>Bob drew a long breath. &#8220;This is work<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30"></a>[30]</span>
really worth while doing,&#8221; he said, his eyes
shining. &#8220;It must be great to know that each
new dam you complete will make thousands of
acres of land green and productive. I will be
glad to help.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the spirit,&#8221; said Whiskers. &#8220;As I
said before, it is good work. The reward is
not all in the pay you get. It is in the achievement
and the service that you render. That is
all that you can look forward to in the way
of payment. But I have talked too long. You
must be tired after your long trip. You&#8217;d
better chase off to bed.&#8221;</p>

<p>But Bob would not go. He kept asking Mr.
Whitney questions about the details of the work
and the man had to answer. He saw in the
boy&#8217;s enthusiasm something of the enthusiasm
he himself had felt when he had joined the
Service, and which he had never lost, in spite
of the disappointments and hard knocks that
had come his way. Finally, however, he insisted
on breaking up the conversation. But before
Bob left he said to him quite earnestly and seriously,
&#8220;I have told you about the Service, Bob,
and I want you to think pretty carefully about<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31"></a>[31]</span>
it. If you once start, you will have a hard time
breaking away. There are a lot of other things
you can do which will bring you more money
and more fame. This working for the Government,
the extending of the territory of the
country and increasing its value, gets into your
blood and once it does you will never be fit for
anything else. It is not too late to stop now
if you want to. Good night, and let me know
in the morning what you decide to do.&#8221;</p>

WHEN THE CHIEF WAS AWAY</h2>
</div>

<p>Bob was asleep almost as soon as he touched
the pillow. The long trip on the train had tired
him more than he had thought and he did not
wake until a heavy pounding on the door broke
into his slumbers. Jerry King came in when he
at last answered.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Chief sent me up to wake you. Breakfast
is almost over.&#8221;</p>

<p>Bob shook the sleep out of his eyes and hustled
into his clothes. When he came downstairs
with Jerry he found that Mr. Whitney had
already finished his breakfast and had gone out.
So he and Jerry had theirs. During the meal
Bob tried again to draw his new comrade out,
but the same unwillingness to talk possessed
Jerry. Bob rather wondered what was the
matter. He had not been used to meeting with
such reserve. He remembered also that during<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33"></a>[33]</span>
the conversation on the porch the night before
Jerry had spoken hardly a word but sat in his
chair motionless. At last, giving it up as a bad
job, he finished his meal in silence. Steve
Whitney met them in the lobby.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, fellows,&#8221; he greeted them, &#8220;my orders
have come, or at least I think they will be my
marching orders. A telegram has just been
given me. I&#8217;ve got to go to El Paso and meet
the Division Superintendent. It probably means
my little vacation is over.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll be glad to get to work,&#8221; said Jerry
shortly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think you will have to wait much
longer,&#8221; said Whitney laughing. Then he turned
to Bob. &#8220;Made up your mind yet? You can
go along with me if you&#8217;re going back East&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not so&#8217;s you could notice it!&#8221; exclaimed Bob
indignantly. &#8220;I&#8217;ve made up my mind but it&#8217;s
to stay right here!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, if that&#8217;s the way you feel about it,&#8221;
laughed Mr. Whitney, &#8220;all right. Bob, I&#8217;m
afraid the Service has got you. Now as to the
future. I probably won&#8217;t come back up here
so I&#8217;ll telegraph you where to meet me as soon<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34"></a>[34]</span>
as I know where we&#8217;ve been assigned. It&#8217;ll only
be a few days now, I reckon. My train&#8217;s going
in a few minutes, so I&#8217;ll have to hustle and pack.
I&#8217;ll see you at the train.&#8221;</p>

<p>Bob got up early in order to see the Canyon
at sunrise the morning after Steve Whitney
went away, but found that in comparison to
the sunset it was tame. Yet so inspiring was it
that he was glad he had taken the trouble. The
panorama spread before his eyes was one of
which no other country could boast. Bob had
seen pictures of it, had read about it, and had
been taught about it from his geography, but
nothing that he had read or heard or learned had
given him even a faint idea of the glory of the
thing as it actually was, no matter what time of
the day it was seen.</p>

<p>After drinking his fill of the wonder he went
back to the hotel to breakfast and found Jerry
King already at the table. The other boy continued
to puzzle him. Jerry made no effort to
begin a conversation and Bob refused to lay
himself open to a turn-down by making the first
remark. However, as he rose from the table
he asked if Jerry had been down the Bright<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35"></a>[35]</span>
Angel Trail to the very bottom of the Canyon.</p>

<p>Jerry answered shortly, &#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Go with me this morning?&#8221; asked Bob as
shortly.</p>

<p>This time the answer was no&mdash;once was
enough. So Bob, determined to get as much fun
as possible out of his enforced stay at the
Canyon, started out alone and joined the group
of tourists in front of the hotel. They were
already preparing to make the descent. He
decided to walk rather than trust to one of
the funny fat little mules which were provided
for the visitors who were too stout or too lazy
to use the means of locomotion given them by
nature.</p>

<p>At last the start was made and after a walk
of about a quarter of a mile along the rim the
party came to the head of the Bright Angel
Trail which led to the bottom. At first the
going was fairly easy, but soon the trail grew
steeper and steeper and Bob was amazed to see
the calm way in which the little donkeys kept
their footing, particularly when they were carrying
large and heavy human beings. Owing
to the immense zigzags that the trail had to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36"></a>[36]</span>
take in order to provide a safe path, a lot of
ground had to be covered. Therefore it was
not until almost noon that the party reached the
first plateau. This &#8220;plateau&#8221; is in reality far
from flat. It is merely a slight leveling out of
the general declivity about two-thirds of the
way down.</p>

<p>Along with the most determined of the tourists,
Bob made the final descent to the bank of
the river. It had been hot enough up at the
hotel. On the plateau it was fairly sizzling, but
once at the bottom the heat was intense. This
probably accounted for the fact that the whole
party was quite ready to begin the return trip
as soon as the tourists got back their breath.</p>

<p>At the very depth of the Canyon Bob suddenly
realized what the Reclamation Service
had to contend with. It was places like this
which needed feats of engineering skill to let
people even get near to them, that the Service
had to contend with. Nature was the Service&#8217;s
foe. Its task was to subjugate her to its own
ends. Of course this Canyon was too big; the
desert land was too far away for any irrigation
project to be thought of.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37"></a>[37]</span>But it was in similar canyons, smaller, perhaps,
that the Service built its dams. Down the
sides of cliffs like these, which even the mountain
goats had difficulty in mastering, the Service
had to build its roads. It was to such desolate
beauty that the Service brought progress and
the service of mankind. In his imagination
Bob saw the smooth face of an enormous dam
filling even this great canyon,&mdash;generating
enough horse power to run all the factories of
the West, and collecting enough water to irrigate
all the homes that could be made on the
great American desert. Right then nothing was
too stupendous a task for final achievement.
His whole being thrilled with the thought that
he was to be a part of the Service, that he was
to have a hand in the great work that it was
doing and would do.</p>

<p>His mind busy with these thoughts, he found
that the long climb to the top did not bother
him. After a wash-up he had supper and went
out on the hotel piazza. The sun had gone but
its last banners of light were flung up against
the sky behind the farthest horizon. The depths
of the Canyon were black. Out of this rose<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38"></a>[38]</span>
myriad pinnacles, dim in outline, rich in deep
colors. Just at the opposite rim a strip of color
spun along, tipping the horizon with a golden
glow.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wasn&#8217;t much after all your trouble to get
down, was it?&#8221; said a voice behind him. Bob
looked up to find that Jerry had appeared.</p>

<p>&#8220;It was worth the trouble anyway,&#8221; answered
Bob as Jerry settled into a chair. He realized
that Jerry&#8217;s remark was in reference to his trip
down the Canyon. &#8220;I&#8217;m mighty glad I went.
I wouldn&#8217;t have missed it for anything.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I wouldn&#8217;t go again for a pretty,&#8221;
returned Jerry. &#8220;Once is a great plenty.
Besides, there isn&#8217;t any chance of our ever
doing anything with this place. Anything
useful, that is. I don&#8217;t know what the Chief
wanted to bring us up here for. Wish we were
on the job. Hate this loafing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish we were too,&#8221; agreed Bob, warming
up to Jerry&#8217;s unexpected long speech. &#8220;Isn&#8217;t
there anything exciting we can do while waiting
for Mr. Whitney?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not a thing if we&#8217;ve got to stay here,&#8221;
said the other and relapsed into silence.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39"></a>[39]</span>After a long period Jerry spoke again almost
to himself. &#8220;If we were only up Green River
way, now, there would be a chance. I was by
there once. There&#8217;s a canyon there we might
do something with&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you mean there&#8217;s a chance for a dam?&#8221;
asked Bob.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said the other. &#8220;But it would mean
tunneling through a mountain to get the water
out after the dam was built. That is nothing
for the Service if only we could get a road down
into the canyon. Need it to get machinery and
materials down to the dam site. Nobody&#8217;s ever
gone through the canyon alive, so no one knows
whether a road is practical or not. Lots have
started. I&#8217;ve sort of a hankering to try it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What is it called?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The Labyrinth. It is only about sixty miles
long. But in those sixty miles there are more
rapids, and bad ones, than there are in all of
the Grand Canyon. Well, I reckon there isn&#8217;t
much chance of my ever tackling it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why not?&#8221; asked Bob.</p>

<p>But evidently Jerry had used up all the words
he had on tap. After some sort of unsatisfactory<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40"></a>[40]</span>
answer he got up and moved off in
silence in the aloof way he had. Bob sat still
and thought over what the other had just told
him. The plan of exploring this canyon which
no one else had ever been able to go through
fired his imagination. He wanted to try it.</p>

<p>His reverie was broken into a few moments
later by a bell boy coming out with a telegram.
It was from Mr. Whitney, and sent from El
Paso. Bob opened it and read: &#8220;Unexpected
developments. Must go Washington. Back
within three weeks. Will wire further instructions.&#8221;</p>

<p>For a moment or two after he had read the
message all Bob could think of was that there
was a long procession of boring days to be met.
It would have been a lot easier if Jerry King had
been more of a chum and less of a grouch. But
orders were orders and it was up to him to
obey. He stuck the telegram in his pocket and
set off to find Jerry, if that was possible. Jerry
had a way of disappearing, only to show up at
meal times.</p>

<p>He had not gone but a few steps before a
great idea come to him. Why couldn&#8217;t they<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41"></a>[41]</span>
try the Labyrinth Canyon stunt in the three
weeks the Chief would be away? This idea
lent him speed in his search for his companion.
At last he found Jerry sitting in a tall chair
watching some tourists play pool. He went over
to the other boy and said, &#8220;Come on along outside
for a minute, Jerry. I&#8217;ve got something
to tell you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Once again on the piazza Jerry said, &#8220;What
is it?&#8221;</p>

<p>Bob held forth the telegram. The other read
it and said questioningly, &#8220;Well?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you see?&#8221; said Bob eagerly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t I see what?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We can tackle the Labyrinth if it isn&#8217;t too
far away.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re crazy. That would take money.
Besides it&#8217;s too risky for a tenderfoot.&#8221;</p>

<p>But Bob was too much in earnest to take the
last remark seriously. He laughed. &#8220;Oh, I&#8217;m
a tenderfoot all right but I know something
about paddling a canoe. Had a lot of it last
summer and I can swim. And if it is not too
expensive, I&#8217;ve got the money. Any other
objections?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42"></a>[42]</span>He pulled out a draft his father had given
him before he had left for the West. His
father had said it was for emergencies and
had drawn it for a respectable sum. Jerry
looked at the figures and whistled. &#8220;Oh, I guess
you&#8217;ve got the money all right. It&#8217;d be enough
to put the thing through. But it&#8217;s too risky.&#8221;</p>

<p>This was too much for Bob. He flared up.
&#8220;I don&#8217;t see that <i>you&#8217;re</i> taking me. If I want
to go, I can go. You said you wanted to try
it. Now you&#8217;re the one who&#8217;s backing out when
the chance to try it comes along. I think it&#8217;s
you who has the tender and <i>cold</i> feet.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Cut it out, kid,&#8221; said Jerry. Evidently Bob&#8217;s
tone of determination had impressed him. Also
the taunt about cold feet stung him. &#8220;I just
wanted to make sure you wanted to go, that&#8217;s
all. You&#8217;re taking a chance of never going back
East again.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That part is all right,&#8221; said Bob, now on
his mettle. The way Jerry had taken his suggestion
had got his fighting blood up and he
was now determined to go through with the
adventure at all costs. &#8220;How far is it to the
place we start?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43"></a>[43]</span>&#8220;About six hours on the train,&#8221; was the
answer. &#8220;We ought to be able to find a boat
when we get there. If we&#8217;re going to do it
at all we&#8217;ve got to start in a hurry. Otherwise
we won&#8217;t be back here when the Chief&#8217;s telegram
is due. That is,&#8221; he added, &#8220;if we live
to get the Chief&#8217;s telegram.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, don&#8217;t be so pessimistic,&#8221; said Bob. &#8220;I
bet we&#8217;ll come through alive and kicking. Shall
we start in the morning?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m game.&#8221; And with this Jerry turned
on his heel and walked off. At the door he
flung back, &#8220;If we&#8217;re going on that train you&#8217;d
better hit the hay soon. You&#8217;ll need all the
strength you&#8217;ve got.&#8221;</p>

THE LABYRINTH</h2>
</div>

<p>Late in the afternoon of the next day the
two boys dropped off the train at a little station
in the desert. There was no hotel among the
houses scattered along the track but they were
lucky enough to find a room over the general
store in which to sleep.</p>

<p>As they had so little time in which to accomplish
their plan every minute was valuable, so,
as soon as they had provided for the night, they
started out to find some sort of a boat to carry
them on their adventure.</p>

<p>The proprietor of the store, who was also
their host, directed them to a man he thought
might have one. The latter, a rancher in a small
way, was rather dubious as to the boat&#8217;s being
in a condition to navigate. &#8220;It&#8217;s down by the
river,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Been down there pretty nigh
a year, too, ef somebody hain&#8217;t swiped it. Take<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45"></a>[45]</span>
ye down to look at it in the mornin&#8217;. Ef you&#8217;re
aimin&#8217; to commit suicide tryin&#8217; to get through
the Labyrinth, it ought to be jest the thing for
you. &#8217;Twas built by a party what aimed to try
the stunt but got cold feet before they tackled
it. They give it to me, so ef you&#8217;re willin&#8217; to
pay about ten dollars, you&#8217;re welcome to it.&#8221;</p>

<p>This sounded good to the boys and they went
back to the store feeling in luck. They had
brought with them the air mattress which Jerry
had advised buying at the Canyon, as it would
give them a dry bed no matter where they
might be forced to camp. They added to this
before going to bed by buying provisions from
the storekeeper, endeavoring to get as much
food in as little bulk as possible. At last their
preparations for the trip were complete, and
they went to bed anxious for the morning, and
hoping that the boat would prove what they
wanted.</p>

<p>In order not to lose any time they packed the
dunnage they expected to take into two loads
and carried it with them when they went down
the next morning to inspect the boat. It was
a long way from the little town to the river and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46"></a>[46]</span>
their spirits sagged as the loads grew heavier.
However, they found the boat covered over by
brushwood and some old sail-cloth, and when
its owner pulled it out into the open they were
much encouraged. The boat was about sixteen
feet long, high at both ends with water-tight
compartments.</p>

<p>&#8220;If it only doesn&#8217;t leak,&#8221; said Jerry, &#8220;it will
be all right.&#8221;</p>

<p>They pulled it into the water and watched
with bated breath. It leaked badly and Jerry
was disgusted. Bob, however, knowing more
about boats than his companion, realized that
the long time the boat had been out of water
had caused the strips to contract and in all
probability a few hours&#8217; soaking would make
them tight. Bob had insisted on putting the boat
into the water before paying for it and as the
water came in more slowly after a few minutes,
he was satisfied. They paid the man and he
went off after wishing them a rather pessimistic
farewell.</p>

<p>&#8220;I reckon I&#8217;ve seen as many as twenty danged
fools try this stunt and I&#8217;ve never heard of any
of them comin&#8217; out the other end&mdash;that is,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47"></a>[47]</span>
comin&#8217; out breathin&#8217;. It&#8217;s a pity when the two
of you air so young. I&#8217;ll be right glad to hear
from you ef you do get through, seein&#8217; as how
it was my boat. Danged ef I figger I&#8217;ll hear,
howsomever. Good-bye to you.&#8221;</p>

<p>With this he started back up the trail, shaking
his head. Jerry suggested they make camp and
wait until the boat was water-tight. This
seemed a good suggestion, so they built a fire
and made some coffee. In the afternoon Bob
baled out the water that was in the boat and
after watching carefully for half an hour found
that no more water had come in.</p>

<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s all right,&#8221; he called to Jerry, who was
building a lean-to for the night.</p>

<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; answered the other, &#8220;pull her
up on the bank and we&#8217;ll stow away everything
that we don&#8217;t need for the night. We can leave
just as soon as it is light to-morrow. We
wouldn&#8217;t get far enough along to pay us for
starting now.&#8221;</p>

<p>The boat easily carried all the things they had
brought. Jerry took particular care in stowing
away a box which he had hung onto jealously
since they started. It was rather a mysterious<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48"></a>[48]</span>
looking case about which he had volunteered no
information. Up to this time Bob had not questioned
him, although he had wondered what
was in it. However, as Jerry reserved the safest
and dryest part of the boat for it Bob ventured
to ask what it was.</p>

<p>&#8220;Light transit,&#8221; said Jerry. &#8220;We will need
it to make sure that a road into the canyon is
possible. What might seem quite possible to
the eye, is often no use at all. I thought we&#8217;d
better make sure.&#8221;</p>

<p>Bob was interested. He had read of and
knew in a general way what use engineers made
of transits and levels but up to this time he had
not had an opportunity to see them in actual
service.</p>

<p>&#8220;If we&#8217;ve got to use it, Jerry,&#8221; he suggested,
&#8220;don&#8217;t you think you had better tell me something
about it now while we&#8217;ve got a chance?
Then I&#8217;ll be of more use when we get down to
the canyon.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; said Jerry rather ungraciously.
&#8220;But you&#8217;ll soon catch on to it when we start
work. You&#8217;ll have to.&#8221;</p>

<p>At the same time he took the case out of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49"></a>[49]</span>
boat and opened it. It was a beautiful little
instrument, weighing hardly twenty-five pounds.
It stood on telescopic legs of steel. Jerry
showed Bob how to set it up and to manipulate
the four screws by which it was made level.
Then he showed him how to focus the telescope
and all the other elementary things. After a
little practice Bob felt competent to give Jerry
what help he would need.</p>

<p>&#8220;Gee whiz, it&#8217;s interesting,&#8221; said Bob at last,
when Jerry put the fascinating instrument away.</p>

<p>&#8220;After you&#8217;ve carried one for about five
years you won&#8217;t think it so interesting,&#8221;
returned Jerry, suddenly remembering that he
was a grouch.</p>

<p>The night came down cold. The boys were
glad to bundle up into their sleeping bags and
get what rest they could. The novelty and
excitement could keep Bob awake for only a
little while, for the danger into which he was
headed did not worry him for a moment, and he
was very tired. He wanted adventure and he
was going to have it. Only one thing deterred
him at all, and that was the thought of his
father. But before he had left the hotel at the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50"></a>[50]</span>
Grand Canyon he had written a letter explaining
to the older Hazard what he was planning to
do. He had, of course, minimized the danger.
But, even so, when Mr. Hazard got the letter
he was very much upset and had an impulse to
get on the next train and bring his boy back
to civilization, if he still had a boy to bring
back.</p>

<p>Jerry was first awake in the morning. He
roused Bob but not until he had a fire going and
the coffee-pot singing merrily. Bob got up
and, slipping off his clothes, dived into the river.
The water was cold but not unpleasantly so.
Jerry looked at him for a minute and laughed
as he came out dripping.</p>

<p>&#8220;You won&#8217;t need to <i>take</i> a bath after this.
If you don&#8217;t have about five unexpected ones
during the day I miss my guess.&#8221;</p>

<p>Bob laughed. &#8220;Well, water won&#8217;t hurt us.
You&#8217;re sort of a grouch, aren&#8217;t you, Jerry?&#8221; he
said pleasantly. It was a tactless thing to say,
for the other boy shut up like a clam and except
as it was absolutely necessary he gave no openings
for further conversation.</p>

<p>&#8220;Jolly sort of trip I&#8217;m going to have,&#8221; thought<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51"></a>[51]</span>
Bob, &#8220;if Jerry is going to keep up this sort of
thing. I ought never to have said he was a
grouch, though.&#8221;</p>

<p>After breakfast they rolled up their mattress
and stowed away in the boat the things they
had used during the night. At last they were
ready to start.</p>

<p>&#8220;We might as well be going,&#8221; said Jerry.
&#8220;Hop in.&#8221; He was already at the oars, which
he had tied securely to the oarlocks. The wisdom
of this precaution was later to be proved
to them. Once Bob was in, Jerry pulled off. He
was a fair oarsman and going with the current
the boat made good time. At this point the
river was broad and, except for the towering
hills which rose in the distance, it might have
been a peaceful tributary stream of any civilized
river. Its calm surface gave no warning
of what was to come in the way of rapids and
whirlpools. After a bit Bob took the oars and
as he had had more experience with boats he
made even better time than Jerry had. Turn
by turn they went through the morning.</p>

<p>It was not long before the rolling hills on
either side of the stream gave way to rocky<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52"></a>[52]</span>
cliffs and deep gulches through which little
creeks trickled into the river. The current
grew faster and here and there an ugly rock
showed its head above the surface, the water
rushing by angrily on either side.</p>

<p>&#8220;Getting a little interesting,&#8221; ventured Bob.</p>

<p>&#8220;This isn&#8217;t anything,&#8221; growled Jerry, and
then they went on again in silence.</p>

<p>About noon they pulled in to a rocky ledge
and had some lunch, and after a short rest
went on again. Towards the middle of the
afternoon, as they were turning a bend in the
river, Bob, sitting in the stern, saw what seemed
to him to be a mountain cut in half.</p>

<p>&#8220;That must be it,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Look, Jerry!&#8221;</p>

<p>Jerry turned. &#8220;You&#8217;re right, I guess. It&#8217;s
the Labyrinth.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We ought to get there by night. It&#8217;s only
around the next bend,&#8221; Bob ventured.</p>

<p>Jerry looked around again and laughed
shortly. &#8220;We&#8217;ll be lucky if we&#8217;re there by
to-morrow night. That cliff is twenty miles
away at least.&#8221;</p>

<p>Bob was amazed. It looked to be only about
a mile away. Jerry must be mistaken. But<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53"></a>[53]</span>
Jerry was right. Although they had covered
a great deal of distance, when it came time to
camp for the night the cleft in the mountain
seemed as far away as when Bob had first
sighted it. Two days later, however, they did
reach it. And it was not until the river had
swirled them through this giant gateway that
they encountered any rapid water. They began
to think that the passage of the Labyrinth had
been overestimated.</p>

<p>In the late afternoon of the second day, after
they had slipped silently by the towering walls
of the canyon which here came down sharply
into the river, and had swung around a bend,
Jerry sighted the first rough going.</p>

<p>&#8220;Pull in to shore, Bob,&#8221; he said quickly.
&#8220;We&#8217;d better take a look at what&#8217;s coming
before we tackle it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Once ashore they made their way as near to
the rapids as possible. The water boiled in
fury as it rushed by the rocks that opposed its
way.</p>

<p>&#8220;Gee whiz!&#8221; ejaculated Bob. &#8220;This is worse
than anything I&#8217;ve tackled before&mdash;ever!&#8221;</p>

<p>Jerry laughed and said, &#8220;There&#8217;ll be a lot<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54"></a>[54]</span>
worse than this before we&#8217;re through, I&#8217;m
afraid. This isn&#8217;t much. We&#8217;ll be able to
shoot it all right.&#8221;</p>

<p>Back in the boat Jerry took the oars, and,
helped by the current, drifted swiftly towards
the first rapids of the shallow and dangerous
passage. Once into the white water they found
the going easier than they had expected. After
a struggle and a narrow escape or two from
shipwreck on jagged rocks they saw smoother
water ahead. But this held a new danger.
Here the river made a short bend, and the current,
throwing itself against the opposite bank,
threatened to dash them against it before they
could control their boat.</p>

<p>It was a ticklish moment. They shot out of
the white spray and were headed for the rocky
wall. &#8220;Quick, Jerry!&#8221; yelled Bob. &#8220;Pull her
&#8217;round.&#8221;</p>

<p>Jerry used both his arms on the right hand
oar and a moment later, breathless and a little
exhausted, they came to quieter water.</p>

<p>&#8220;Like shooting the chutes, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221; said
Bob, putting his feeling into words as soon as
he could speak. &#8220;Great sport!&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55"></a>[55]</span>Jerry, however, bent to his oars, betraying
his emotion only by the gleam of his eyes. No
more rapids of any consequence hindered their
way the remainder of the afternoon. It was
not until well along the next morning that they
came again to anything which really could be
called dangerous.</p>

<p>The first intimation the boys had of the
approaching rapids was the increasing speed of
the boat. As they looked ahead the water
seemed clear and unbroken, but some current
stronger than usual was hurrying them along.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re in for it again,&#8221; yelled Jerry to Bob,
who was rowing. &#8220;Back water&mdash;hard!&#8221;</p>

<p>Bob dug in the blades of his oars with all the
force he could muster. The boat lost a little
headway but the effort came too late. The current
had them in its grasp. A quick rush in
the blinding spray and the boys found themselves
in the icy water. Bob, however, had
kept hold of one of the oars of the overturned
boat and he thanked his stars that Jerry had
had the foresight to tie it to the oarlock.</p>

<p>As soon as he shook the water out of his
eyes a glance showed him what had happened.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56"></a>[56]</span>
Some freak of nature had left a ledge in the
bottom of the river over which the water
flowed, making a waterfall of perhaps six or
eight feet. So even was the edge of the fall
that it had not been visible to them as they
came down stream through the first rough
water.</p>

<p>&#8220;All right?&#8221; called Bob to Jerry, who had
been carried past him by the foam-flecked water.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure,&#8221; the other sputtered. &#8220;Just keep
drifting and we&#8217;ll land on that point down there.
I&#8217;ll stand by to help beach the boat when you
get there.&#8221;</p>

<p>The boys pulled the boat up on the rocky
ledge that Jerry had called a point, where they
discovered to their great relief that no great
damage had been done. The water-tight compartments
had held and their provisions and
clothing were quite dry. A few minutes later
they were off again, but paddling a little more
cautiously this time, for they had experienced
the first trick the Labyrinth could play. They
would be better prepared for the next.</p>

<p>A stretch of good going gave them time for a
little reflection. Bob busied himself with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57"></a>[57]</span>
thoughts of a possible dam site. It seemed queer
to him that Jerry had appeared to take no
interest in the canyon for this purpose.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why haven&#8217;t we looked for a place for the
dam?&#8221; Bob ventured at last. &#8220;We&#8217;ve passed
a lot of places where the canyon walls were
narrow.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No hurry,&#8221; answered Jerry. &#8220;It&#8217;d be too
far to tunnel a canal through the mountain
right here. The valley we want to irrigate
is miles farther down. There&#8217;s no use bothering
our heads about it until we get nearer.&#8221;</p>

<p>Satisfied, Bob let the matter rest. So far the
journey, with the exception of the one upset,
had proved rather tame going and both boys
were a little surprised that former explorers
had found it impossible to make the passage.
The boy from the East rather doubted that
they would meet any worse obstacles than they
had already. But Jerry was more skeptical.
When Bob ventured that he thought the trip was
a cinch, Jerry agreed, with a reservation.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s been a cinch so far, but just wait.
We&#8217;ve not started to get into trouble yet. We&#8217;ll
get ours all right before we&#8217;re through.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58"></a>[58]</span>Hardly were the words out of his mouth
when more trouble ensued. The canyon broadened
and instead of the river being confined in
a deep, fast-flowing current, it was spread out
into a shallow, dawdling stream. Several times
they grounded, there was so little water covering
the sand. Here and there rocks stuck
above the water, and in places it was necessary
to jump out and push the boat into a deeper
part.</p>

<p>&#8220;It seems to me we&#8217;re going to get that
trouble right now,&#8221; said Bob. &#8220;As soon as
this narrows a little bit, if it doesn&#8217;t get deeper
I bet we&#8217;ll have rapids with a vengeance.&#8221;</p>

<p>This turned out to be the case, for the water
went faster as they proceeded, and instead of
the sandy bottom, rocks became more and more
numerous, the water rushing by them with angry
murmurs. Bob had difficulty in keeping the
craft from mishap. After narrowly escaping
shipwreck between two particularly vicious looking
jagged stones he decided that there was
no safety in going on the way they had. Suddenly
he had an idea.</p>

<p>&#8220;The next time we get to a shallow spot,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59"></a>[59]</span>
Jerry,&#8221; he ordered between strokes, &#8220;take hold
of the painter and jump out. We must bring
the bow up stream.&#8221;</p>

<p>Jerry saw that Bob must have some good
reason for the maneuver and without a word
took hold of the rope which was fastened to
the bow of the light craft and slipped overboard
at the first likely spot. Pressing himself against
a rock, he held taut and let the action of the
current, helped by Bob&#8217;s pulling strongly on one
oar, turn the boat&#8217;s nose in the direction from
which they had come. It was ticklish work in
view of the position in which they were placed.
But once around he saw what Bob had in mind
when he had planned the stunt, for as soon as he
was aboard again Bob began rowing against
the current. This allowed the boat to go very
slowly down stream. In this way he had much
more control than merely backing water could
give him. Besides he could see for himself what
was coming, as in a rowing position he naturally
faced the stern.</p>

<p>&#8220;A good idea,&#8221; commented Jerry as Bob, due
to the new method of progress, missed hitting
a wicked rock.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60"></a>[60]</span>This word of commendation from his comrade
pleased Bob immensely. It was the first word
of approval he had had from his gloomy chum.
&#8220;Easier, that&#8217;s all!&#8221; he answered. But both
boys were glad when a new stretch of still
water was reached.</p>

<p>Just before sundown next day they came to
an obstacle which at first sight rather daunted
them. As they rounded a bend, the most surprising
bit of scenery they had so far encountered
flashed before their eyes. The canyon
seemed to stop, to have no outlet. It was as if
they had come into an amphitheater from which
there was no escape. Even the way they had
come in was not visible. The point of rocks
which had made the bend in the river merged
into the sides of the canyon in such a way as
to make it seem that there was no opening at all.</p>

<p>&#8220;Golly!&#8221; almost whispered Bob, awed by the
strangeness of the scene. &#8220;I reckon this is why
no one came through. There doesn&#8217;t seem to
be any way to get out&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s got to be a way through,&#8221; growled
Jerry. &#8220;Where does the water go? Must go
somewhere; can&#8217;t stop here, that&#8217;s sure as rain.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61"></a>[61]</span>&#8220;P&#8217;r&#8217;aps&mdash;p&#8217;r&#8217;aps it goes through a cave,&#8221;
suggested Bob. &#8220;I&#8217;ve read about underground
rivers, haven&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, shucks,&#8221; said Jerry. &#8220;Probably the
way out is hidden just like the way we&#8217;ve come.
Look back. You can&#8217;t see how we got in here,
can you?&#8221;</p>

<p>Bob had to admit this was so. &#8220;Maybe you&#8217;re
right. Anyhow, it&#8217;s so dark we can&#8217;t tell for
certain. I think we&#8217;d better get ashore somewheres
and make camp. We&#8217;ll find out about
it in the morning.&#8221;</p>

<p>When they awoke the next morning the
rounded chamber of the canyon was flooded
with light.</p>

<p>&#8220;Find your ridge,&#8221; invited Bob politely, &#8220;the
one behind which our river flows on and on
and&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, shut up!&#8221; was Jerry&#8217;s ungrateful retort.
Since he had opened his eyes he had endeavored
to find just that thing&mdash;with no success. But
he would not own up until he had had another
long look. But after a while he had to give in.</p>

<p>&#8220;Looks like you were right,&#8221; he said tersely.
&#8220;The river must go through a tunnel, because<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62"></a>[62]</span>
it sure comes out on t&#8217;other side. This river is
part of what goes through the Grand Canyon.&#8221;</p>

<p>Bob had the good sense not to gloat openly
over Jerry&#8217;s discomfiture.</p>

<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; was all he said. &#8220;But let&#8217;s find
the mouth of the tunnel. Hustle up with the
grub.&#8221;</p>

<p>They gulped their coffee and soon cast off,
letting the stream carry them gently towards
the face of the great obstruction. A few minutes
later they saw the solution of this mystery.
Under the cliff the river flowed swiftly and
silently into a dark hole.</p>

<p>&#8220;Back water,&#8221; said Bob. &#8220;We&#8217;d better
explore a little before we start through.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t mean to go through it, do you?&#8221;
said Jerry, startled out of his usual calm manner
by the way in which the other boy had spoken.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why not?&#8221; returned the other. &#8220;It looks
like the only way we can go, doesn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Jerry, &#8220;but&mdash;I didn&#8217;t figure on
anything like this.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We can&#8217;t go back again, can we?&#8221; asked
Bob. &#8220;There doesn&#8217;t seem to be anything else
to do but to try the tunnel.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63"></a>[63]</span>His first surprise over, Jerry saw that Bob
was right. If they didn&#8217;t go through the tunnel
they would probably never go anywhere. It
would be more than their strength could accomplish
to force the boat back through the rapids
they had encountered. And even if they could
reach the top of the cliffs, Jerry knew that they
would die of thirst before they could make their
way to civilization.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re right, I guess,&#8221; he assented. &#8220;We&#8217;ve
got to do it. Come on, we might as well get it
over.&#8221;</p>

<p>But Bob, who was at the oars, pulled towards
the bank. &#8220;Just a jiffy, Jerry, I&#8217;ve got a hunch.
Why couldn&#8217;t a dam be built here?&#8221;</p>

<p>In a flash Jerry saw what Bob meant, and
for a second was ashamed that in the excitement
he had forgotten the real object of their expedition.
They were out to find a place where a
dam might be built that would bring the water
of life to the parched desert on the other side of
the mountain&mdash;and he had forgotten all this
when his personal safety was in danger. He
looked up at the wall nature had built across
the canyon. This time it was not as an obstruction<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64"></a>[64]</span>
that he saw it but as a possible location
for a dam. When the boat touched the shore,
he brought out the transit and set it up. Bob
waited breathlessly for his decision. At last
Jerry took his eye from the telescope.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; he said slowly, &#8220;it looks possible to
me. Better&#8217;n that, Bob, it looks mighty lucky.
Nature has given us a big help if it turns out
that it <i>is</i> possible.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You think my hunch may be right then?&#8221;
put in Bob, his eyes shining. &#8220;P&#8217;r&#8217;aps this big
wall might become part of the dam itself!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yep! Here, take a squint through the telescope
and see for yourself. The top of this
wall is more&#8217;n halfway to the top of the
canyon.&#8221;</p>

<p>Bob applied his eye to the glass and confirmed
his comrade&#8217;s statement. &#8220;Can&#8217;t we take some
measurements?&#8221; he wanted to know.</p>

<p>&#8220;Won&#8217;t be necessary. We couldn&#8217;t climb to
the top anyway&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then the transit&#8217;s no use?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Except as a telescope. But at that it&#8217;s told
us a lot. But that was a wonderful hunch of
yours, Bob. I guess you must be a born<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65"></a>[65]</span>
engineer. To put it through we&#8217;d have to stop
up the mouth of the tunnel into which the river
runs. Then extra masonry work on top of the
cliff would bring it up to the necessary height.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll bet a road could be made from the edge
of the canyon to the top of the cliff,&#8221; asserted
Bob confidently, &#8220;and what work had to be
done here at the river bed could be managed by
derricks and cranes from that spot. Don&#8217;t you
think so?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;d be a big saving all right if it could,&#8221;
exclaimed Jerry at last. &#8220;And I believe it will
work. There&#8217;s only one thing more to find out
and that is how long the tunnel is.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s only one way to find out, isn&#8217;t
there?&#8221; said Bob. &#8220;That&#8217;s to go through it.
Are you ready?&#8221;</p>

<p>Jerry realized that they had wonderful news
to bring back to the boss. To find a location
was good work, but to find a dam almost ready-made
would mean such a saving for the Reclamation
Service that the stunt would be almost
unique. It fired his enthusiasm and stilled any
fears he might have of the danger to be
overcome.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66"></a>[66]</span>&#8220;Sure,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Let&#8217;s go to it. If we
get through we&#8217;ll know what we want to know.
If we&mdash;we don&#8217;t, it doesn&#8217;t make much difference,
does it, old man?&#8221;</p>

<p>Impulsively Bob put out his hand. &#8220;We&#8217;ll
win out, Jerry, and we&#8217;ll be proud that <i>we</i> did
it. If something should happen&mdash;it&#8217;s for the
Service!&#8221;</p>

<p>They felt the spirit of pioneers and an
immense loyalty to the Service and what it
stood for. Jerry shook his hand warmly.</p>

<p>A moment later the boys were afloat. As
they got near to the dark entrance they saw
that the jagged rocks which fringed the arch
came very near to the water.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll have to feel our way through,&#8221; said
Bob. &#8220;Lie low until we get in and then try
to catch hold of the roof. We don&#8217;t want to go
through too fast.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; sang out Jerry. &#8220;But I wish
we had a lantern.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Keep wishing,&#8221; laughed Bob. &#8220;That&#8217;s about
all the good it&#8217;ll do you.&#8221;</p>

<p>The very real danger had shaken Jerry out
of his aloofness. This is very often the case in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67"></a>[67]</span>
moments of real peril when even bitter enemies
are drawn together and become friends during
the moments of danger.</p>

<p>&#8220;Duck!&#8221; yelled Jerry.</p>

<p>Hardly were the words out of his mouth
before the boat and its occupants were plunged
into the gloom of the cavern.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t bother about the oars,&#8221; said Bob, his
voice echoing from the walls of the passage.
&#8220;It&#8217;s too dark for &#8217;em. Try to get a hold on the
roof.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was some moments before their combined
efforts to clutch the rocky roof of the tunnel
succeeded sufficiently to bring their boat under
control.</p>

<p>&#8220;Better not let go one hand till you get
another hold!&#8221; cautioned Jerry. &#8220;It&#8217;s mighty
slippery.&#8221;</p>

<p>Foot by foot they made their way through
the tunnel of dread. Cold fear clutched at the
heart of each boy, for any moment disaster
might come in one of a hundred ways&mdash;and
they couldn&#8217;t see it coming!</p>

<p>For a time all went well, but soon Jerry said
in a whisper&mdash;somehow the dark made him<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68"></a>[68]</span>
whisper rather than speak aloud&mdash;&#8220;I can&#8217;t
touch the roof any more, can you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, but it&#8217;s all right,&#8221; said Bob as cheerfully
as he could. &#8220;We&#8217;ll just have to trust to luck.
Sit down and let her rip!&#8221;</p>

<p>They slid noiselessly through the impenetrable
darkness with only the murmur of the water
to break the stillness. The very quietness added
a terror of its own. There was no way of telling
how fast they were going. They could not
see the water and only the rush of cold air
against their faces told them they were moving
at all.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wonder how much longer it&#8217;ll be,&#8221; whispered
Bob, forcing a little laugh. &#8220;Seems like
we&#8217;ve gone miles!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve got beyond wondering how far we&#8217;ve
got to go,&#8221; said Jerry fervently. &#8220;I just want
something to happen. Anything at all would
be better than just sitting helpless.&#8221;</p>

<p>After this attempt at conversation each boy
relapsed into his own gloomy thoughts. These
were suddenly disturbed, however, for Jerry
called out, a note of hope in his voice, &#8220;I think
I see light ahead!&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69"></a>[69]</span>Bob looked and saw it was so. A little speck
of white appeared in the distance. Rapidly it
grew larger. Now the blackness turned to a
gray and in the new light the boys saw why it
was they had come through without rubbing
against the side walls.</p>

<p>The tunnel was absolutely straight and could
not have been carved more evenly through the
mountain by the machinery of man. So swift
was the current that the boat had had no choice
but to go in a straight line, and so wide was the
tunnel that there was slim chance of interference
with its walls. The boys were so thankful that
they were approaching the end of the cavern and
its darkness that neither thought of picking up
the oars which were still dangling idly alongside
the boat. They sat as if fascinated, watching
the opening grow larger and larger.</p>

<p>Nearer it came to them until at last with a
swoop they were out into the daylight. Blinking
in the bright light, their eyes unaccustomed
to the sun, they did not realize that a new
danger threatened them. It was a long moment
before Bob saw what a predicament they
were in.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70"></a>[70]</span>&#8220;Look out for falls!&#8221; he shouted. Jerry
turned and saw that they were on the very
brink of a precipice over which the river was
flowing. It was a nasty hole they were in.
From the noise the water made when it
dropped, Jerry was sure it was a long way to the
bottom. Besides, he saw in a flash that along
its edge gashes of rock stuck up like sentinels.
If they were driven against any one of these it
would mean instant shipwreck.</p>

<p>Simultaneously the boys reached for the oars
but a sudden twist in the current swung the
light craft broadside to the stream and as it
turned the bow grazed a half submerged rock.
The violent shock caused Jerry to lose his balance.
Before he could so much as move, Bob
saw his chum topple overboard, where the current
swept him towards the brink.</p>

<p>Bob&#8217;s first impulse was to jump in after Jerry,
but in a flash he realized he could help him a lot
more if he could save the boat and pull him to
shore. Grabbing the oars, he made a vain effort
to stem the boat&#8217;s headway by pulling against
the stream. He was too late. The current had
the frail craft in its grip.</p>


<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/illus071.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">&#8220;Look out for falls!&#8221; Bob shouted.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71"></a>[71]</span>He thrashed the water with the oars, but, in
spite of his frantic efforts, the boat was whirled
towards what end he could not guess. Just at
the brink a sudden cross rip caught the boat
and flung it against one of the rocks which
the hurrying waters had not been able to wear
away. A sickening crash announced the end
of the craft that had given such good service.
The same jar flung Bob out and a second later
he was hurtling through the foam-laden air
over the edge of the fall.</p>

<p>Luckily for him, the impact which had thrown
him out, served to propel him a little to one
side of the spot where the wrecked boat plunged
ahead of him, and to land him in a pool of deep
water. If this had not happened and he had
crashed into the boat&#8217;s wreckage, broken bones
would have been his portion. As it was, he
missed this fate by only a hair&#8217;s breadth.</p>

<p>After having gone deep into the pool, Bob
came to the surface, his lungs bursting. One
side of his body was numb from the impact of
his fall on the surface of the water. Aside from
this, he was little the worse for his experience.</p>

<p>He was far too dazed to try to swim. But<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72"></a>[72]</span>
the whirlpool below the fall flung him aground
and, instinctively, he scrambled up a rocky shallow
out of the water. He lay there, too stupified
to move. Then the realization came that
for the moment he was safe. A second afterwards
he remembered that Jerry had gone over
the fall too. Something must be done and he
was the only one to do it. Pulling himself
together, he crawled to his knees and looked
out over the surging water below the fall. He
could see no signs of his chum. He groaned.</p>

<p>The fact that Jerry was gone whirled in his
head. He must find out where his comrade was.
Looking down, he saw something which had
escaped his first look. It was a black object
bobbing about in an eddy off the main rush of
the current. He could not be sure that it was
Jerry. His wracked bones told him it was only
driftwood&mdash;that Jerry was gone&mdash;that he
could make no further effort. But his pride
and determination told him he must go on. It
might be Jerry and if he did not make sure he
could never forgive himself.</p>

<p>Stumbling over the rocks, he started off as
fast as he could manage. Half blinded, he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73"></a>[73]</span>
slipped off a rock and was plunged into the current.
Instinct made him swim and the current
helping him, he approached rapidly the place
where he thought he had seen Jerry. Little by
little his forced exertions cleared his brain and
his determination to go on made him forget his
pains.</p>

<p>As he swam nearer to the object which was
swirling around in the water, it constantly
eluded his grasp, but he saw that it was Jerry.
It was as if the river was playing tag with him,
snatching the thing he wanted out of his reach.
Reason told him that Jerry was dead. What
was the use of his trying to keep up this
endeavor when it was all so useless? But something
kept him striving, held him to his aim.
He couldn&#8217;t give up. With a last despairing
lunge, he shot into the eddy and caught his
comrade&#8217;s shoulder. With infinite pains he
swam with his prize to the bank. Safely there,
he had only strength to pull it halfway out of
the water.</p>

<p>He was done, spent for the moment, but the
will power which had driven him on and on
roused him. He had done this much, he must<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74"></a>[74]</span>
do the rest even though every muscle in his
body rebelled. He dragged the lifeless form of
his friend entirely out of the water and managed
to lay him face downward over a round rock,
letting his head lie low. Then Bob flung himself
on Jerry and tried with the weight of his
own body to force the water out of the other&#8217;s
lungs. Only a little success rewarded this
maneuver. Next Bob let the other&#8217;s limp body
roll off onto the ground and, sitting astride of
it, worked his chum&#8217;s arms up and down to
induce breathing. There was no response.</p>

<p>Tears of utter exhaustion streamed down
Bob&#8217;s face. But he kept on. Up and down,
up and down, he pulled the other&#8217;s arms. Just
as he was about to give in to the utter refusal
of his body to go on, he thought he heard a faint
sigh from his comrade. This put new strength
in his arms and new ability to continue. He
was not mistaken. After another moment Jerry
again heaved a long sigh and started breathing,
jerkily at first, yet breathing. When Bob was
sure that there was no mistake, that Jerry was
again in the land of the living, he rolled to one
side, absolutely all in.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75"></a>[75]</span>It was not long, however, before their strong
constitutions asserted themselves. Soon both
boys were able to sit up and take stock of what
damage had been done. Jerry was first on his
feet, pale and a little shaky, but again master
of himself.</p>

<p>&#8220;Was it a close shave?&#8221; he asked as Bob
sat up.</p>

<p>&#8220;You bet,&#8221; was the heartfelt answer. &#8220;I
thought you were a goner sure. But where is
the boat?&#8221;</p>

<p>Jerry scanned the river a moment before
replying: &#8220;She&#8217;s not in sight.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sunk, do you think?&#8221; anxiously queried
Bob. &#8220;Seems to me I remember hitting a rock
just an instant before&mdash;before I did my parachute
act.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know. Come on and let&#8217;s see if it
has gone around the bend. At that we&#8217;ll never
be able to catch up with it unless it&#8217;s grounded
somewheres.&#8221;</p>

<p>Without the boat, they would have no provisions.
The nature of the country didn&#8217;t
promise much in the way of forage, and even
if they succeeded in climbing the canyon walls,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76"></a>[76]</span>
they would probably starve before they reached
civilization. It was a terrifying prospect and
each boy realized it fully. But neither would
show to the other the fear that gripped him.
Stumbling and weak they made their way over
the rocks until they could see around the bend.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hurray!&#8221; called Bob, who was in the lead.
&#8220;There she is.&#8221;</p>

<p>When Jerry came up he saw what had called
forth his comrade&#8217;s shout. The boat was lying
wedged between two rocks on the opposite shore,
one end entirely submerged by the rushing
stream.</p>

<p>&#8220;Can you make it?&#8221; asked Bob. &#8220;We&#8217;ll
have to swim.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess so,&#8221; answered the other. &#8220;It&#8217;s got
to be done.&#8221;</p>

<p>Without hesitating, Bob slipped into the water
and struck out. The current carried him far
down the river from the point he was making
for, but he reached the other side in safety.
Jerry followed and strove manfully, but the
accident had taken a good deal of his strength
and he was thankful when Bob waded out and
gave him a hand to shore.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77"></a>[77]</span>Their boat was a wreck, they found when they
came up to it. The after water-tight compartment
was completely stove in. This had caused
the stern to sink. Two things, however, were
in their favor. The front compartment, in
which they had stowed their blankets, extra
clothing, matches and the transit, was still
intact. Also, as the after compartment had
held only their canned eatables, the ducking had
not hurt them. Few of the cans had fallen
out.</p>

<p>&#8220;I reckon we&#8217;ll have to wait until morning
to see what we can do about fixing the boat,&#8221;
said Bob. &#8220;It&#8217;s much too dark now. Come on,
we&#8217;ll light a fire and be as comfortable as we
can. We&#8217;re sort of inland Robinson Crusoe&#8217;s,
aren&#8217;t we?&#8221;</p>

JERRY&#8217;S STORY</h2>
</div>

<p>The boys cooked some supper and made camp
as best they could from the salvaged cargo of
their boat. Afterwards they slipped out of their
wet clothes and rolled up in the blankets before
the comforting warmth of their fire.</p>

<p>Bob was looking into the glowing coals, thinking
over the events of the day, which, since
they had turned out safely, were now to be
treasured as great adventures. Jerry for his
part was lying looking up at the narrow strip
of star-lit sky showing between the edges of the
canyon&#8217;s top. Suddenly he rolled over and put
his hand on his companion&#8217;s shoulder.</p>

<p>&#8220;You did me a good turn to-day,&#8221; he said
a little huskily. &#8220;Thanks. I&mdash;I can&#8217;t say
things very well but I want to tell you&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Cut it out,&#8221; stammered Bob, confused. &#8220;I
didn&#8217;t do anything.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79"></a>[79]</span>&#8220;Saved my life, I reckon, is all you did. It
must have been some job, too, although I don&#8217;t
know how you did it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;d have done the same thing for me,&#8221;
returned Bob, anxious to get off the subject.
&#8220;Let&#8217;s talk about the dam site.&#8221;</p>

<p>But Jerry was not to be put off. He had
come very close to death and it had shaken
him out of his reserve. Bob had saved him and
he wanted to thank him, to show his gratitude.</p>

<p>&#8220;The old dam can wait. You did a mighty
fine thing for me and I want to know how you
managed it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I just pulled you out and pumped the water
out of you and&mdash;and here you are,&#8221; was Bob&#8217;s
explanation of the episode.</p>

<p>&#8220;Seems to me it was a sort of angry whirlpool
you pulled me from,&#8221; retorted Jerry. But
he saw that he would have a hard time in getting
any more details. &#8220;Anyhow, I know I&#8217;ve
got to thank you for my life&mdash;such as it is!&#8221;</p>

<p>The note of sadness in the latter part of
Jerry&#8217;s remark struck sharply on Bob&#8217;s ears.
It flashed on him that there was possibly a
reason for his comrade&#8217;s fits of silence and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80"></a>[80]</span>
grouchiness. This might very well be mixed up
with his former life. He made an effort to
find out.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter with your life?&#8221; he
asked quickly. &#8220;I&#8217;d want nothing better. To
be with the Reclamation Service and to have
Mr. Whitney for a boss seems pretty good to
me!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That part&#8217;s all right. The Chief is bully,
but&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But what?&#8221; encouraged Bob.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, it&#8217;s nothing I can talk about,&#8221; returned
the other and buried his face in his hands.</p>

<p>Bob watched him for a moment and then
said softly, &#8220;But if you can talk about it p&#8217;r&#8217;aps
it <i>will</i> help. Don&#8217;t you think so?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; hesitated the other after a
pause. &#8220;I reckon it&#8217;s mighty kiddish of me but&mdash;but
I just can&#8217;t help it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Bob was wise enough to wait until Jerry felt
like going on. He knew that the other boy
must be very much upset, quite shocked out of
his customary reserve by the happenings of the
day, to say as much as he had. His patience
was at length rewarded.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81"></a>[81]</span>&#8220;It&#8217;s&mdash;it&#8217;s just that I haven&#8217;t ever had a
family like other fellows. There isn&#8217;t a soul
who&#8217;d care a bit whether I&#8217;d been drowned
to-day or not. If I get along, it&#8217;s all by myself.
Somehow it doesn&#8217;t seem worth while.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s mighty tough,&#8221; said Bob sympathetically,
when Jerry paused for a moment. &#8220;I&#8217;ll
bet Mr. Whitney cares&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But that&#8217;s not like having someone you
<i>belong</i> to!&#8221; cried Jerry. &#8220;The Boss is all
right but he isn&#8217;t a family. Why, the first thing
I remember is selling papers in the Loop back
in Chicago when I was hardly big enough to
walk, and getting licked when I got home
because I didn&#8217;t bring in enough pennies.
Home!&#8221; the boy&#8217;s voice broke on the word. &#8220;It
wasn&#8217;t a home!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Surely your parents wouldn&#8217;t treat you like
that!&#8221; expostulated Bob Hazard, horrified.</p>

<p>&#8220;They weren&#8217;t my parents, no fear. They
told that soon enough. I&#8217;d been taken in by
&#8217;em &#8217;cause they thought I might be useful&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who were they?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, a cabby driver and his wife. The old
woman told me once she wished she&#8217;d left me<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82"></a>[82]</span>
on the doorstep where she found me. But I
stuck it out with them, until I was about fourteen,
I reckon, and then something happened.
One day a man spoke to me on State Street and
asked if I didn&#8217;t want to go out in the country.
He made a wonderful picture of the road on
which there were no houses, the haystacks under
which one could sleep. I&#8217;d never been outside
of the city and it sounded great to me. He said
I could go along with him and he would show
me all these wonders. It was springtime and
the licking I&#8217;d had the night before still smarted,
so I went.&#8221;</p>

<p>Once Jerry had started his tale, it flowed on
without interruption. He seemed anxious to
get it out.</p>

<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t know what I&#8217;d let myself in for.
If anything, my life was a lot worse than it&#8217;d
been before. The Denver Kid was the name
of the man who had picked me up and I soon
learned that he was a tramp&mdash;a hobo. All first
class hoboes get boys who go along with them
and on whom fall all the hard work. Their pay
is in kicks and beatings. And I got my share
of both. I found the country to be as he said<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83"></a>[83]</span>
it was, but we saw very little of it, for the Kid
didn&#8217;t like walking. He stayed close to the railroad
and I saw most of the country from a crack
in the door of a box car, or through the flying
sand thrown up over us as we clung to a rattling
brake-beam.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s hard to escape from a gang of tramps
once you&#8217;re in it. Not for two years was I
able to pull it off. Finally I got my chance to
beat it. Somehow, the sight of kids going to
school had given me a hankering for an education
of some sort and I was ashamed that all
I could do was spell out the newspaper and
read a time-table.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How did you manage it?&#8221; put in Bob, who
was thrilled with the narrative.</p>

<p>&#8220;One day the Kid sent me out to rustle a
hand-out. We were in Iowa at that time, just
when they were bringing in the wheat harvest.
I went up to a farmhouse and started my spiel
on a lady who came to the door. She let me
finish what I had to say, took me in and without
a word gave me a big spread. But when I got
through she made up for her silence. She
began jawing at me just as a mother might.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84"></a>[84]</span>&#8220;I know,&#8221; put in Bob. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t have a
mother either. At least, it was so long ago I
can hardly remember her.&#8221;</p>

<p>Jerry went on with his story. &#8220;She told me
I ought to be ashamed of myself, big, husky boy
that I was, roaming around doing no useful
work. Wanted to know why I didn&#8217;t stay there
and help with the harvest and work for my
living. This wasn&#8217;t the first time that I had
been handed out the same sort of chatter. But
I fell for it this time&mdash;she was sort of homely
and nice. The only thing I was afraid of was
the Denver Kid. I knew if I didn&#8217;t go back with
something to eat he would come and find me
and lick the stuffing out of me. I told Mrs.
Olson&mdash;that was her name&mdash;that I would
have to go but that I&#8217;d come back that night.
For a moment I don&#8217;t think she believed me, but
at last she let me go, giving me quite a lot of
grub.</p>

<p>&#8220;I went back to the bunch and that night just
after we&#8217;d hopped a freight at the water tank,
I took a chance and jumped. By the time the
Denver Kid knew I&#8217;d gone, the train was rolling
too fast for him to follow me.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_85"></a>[85]</span>&#8220;Weren&#8217;t you hurt?&#8221; asked Bob.</p>

<p>&#8220;A few scratches and bruises. Nothing
much. But I didn&#8217;t care; I was free. I walked
back to the farm, camped out under a haystack
and the next morning showed up for breakfast.
Mrs. Olson certainly was good to me while I
was there. After harvest she made me stay on
and let me go to school. I paid for my keep by
doing chores.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Didn&#8217;t the Denver Kid come back after
you?&#8221; Bob wanted to know.</p>

<p>&#8220;Never,&#8221; said Jerry. &#8220;At first I figured he
would, but after a month, when he didn&#8217;t show
up, I doped it out that he thought I&#8217;d fallen
off the train and been killed. Anyhow, I stayed
with the Olson&#8217;s until I had learned all that
the school there could teach me. Mrs. Olson
died soon after and I couldn&#8217;t bear to stay
around any longer. She was as near to folks
as I ever had.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That was tough,&#8221; said Bob sympathetically.
&#8220;What&#8217;d you do then?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I just drifted. I followed the harvest westward
and then I had a chance to take some cattle
down to Colorado. It was about then I met<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86"></a>[86]</span>
Steve Whitney, and he gave me a job, and here
I am.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How did you meet him?&#8221; asked Bob,
expecting that Jerry had found his job in some
exciting way. But he was disappointed.</p>

<p>&#8220;I was hanging around the little town I was
in, waiting for something to turn up. There
was a project under way a few miles out and
I hiked over to give it a look. The Chief caught
me on the dam and thought I looked sort of
hungry. Shipped me to the mess tent and afterwards
put me to work. That&#8217;s all. Now I&#8217;m
here. And I&#8217;ve told you my yarn,&#8221; said Jerry
at last. &#8220;There&#8217;s not much to it, is there?&#8221;</p>

<p>Bob was silent a moment, contrasting the
life of ease he had spent with the experiences
he had just listened to. Before he could speak,
Jerry went on, laughing shortly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry that I inflicted it all upon you,
Bob. I was sort of acting the cry baby,
wasn&#8217;t I?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not at all. I think you have done a lot for
yourself and it must have been awfully exciting
while you were about it. I&#8217;ve never had anything
more exciting in my life than just going<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_87"></a>[87]</span>
to school. This engineering is the biggest
adventure I&#8217;ve ever had. But to-day&mdash;to-day&#8217;s
about made up for all I&#8217;ve missed in the past. I
couldn&#8217;t want much better than this, could I?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I should say not,&#8221; returned Jerry. &#8220;The last
twelve hours ought to last you for the rest of
your life!&#8221;</p>

<p>They talked on until sleep overcame them.
For his part, Bob went off into dreamland feeling
that the day had been well spent. The
adventures had been big adventures and he and
Jerry had come through safely. Jerry had
loosened up and had come out of his shell and
Bob knew that he had made a new friend and
a good one.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak"><small>CHAPTER VI</small><br />


THE END OF THE LABYRINTH</h2>
</div>

<p>But a disappointment awaited them in the
morning. The craft that had brought them this
far was quite beyond repair. It would perhaps
not have been impossible to patch it up if they
had had the necessary tools, but, lacking them,
the boat was a total wreck.</p>

<p>&#8220;What can we do?&#8221; said Bob, his tone showing
his dismay. &#8220;Seems like we are in a bad
fix. &#8216;No boat, no can go!&#8217; as the Chinaman
says.&#8221;</p>

<p>Jerry, however, was not so pessimistic. &#8220;Oh,
I&#8217;m not beaten yet. I think I&#8217;ve got a scheme
that&#8217;ll work, although it means we won&#8217;t be dry
again until we get out of the canyon.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you mean? Are we going to
swim the rest of the way?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re not far off,&#8221; said Jerry, laughing.
&#8220;But even if we&#8217;ve got to swim we won&#8217;t have<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89"></a>[89]</span>
to carry all our junk. Have you thought what
a bully raft our air mattress will make?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Gee whiz, that&#8217;s some idea,&#8221; said Bob.
&#8220;We can load our stuff on it and let it float
down stream, can&#8217;t we?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You bet! But it will be pretty rough
going. We&#8217;ll have to nurse it pretty carefully.
A submarine rock could torpedo it in a minute.
But come on, let&#8217;s try it.&#8221;</p>

<p>They blew up the mattress to its fullest
extent and launched it. Piling on it the things
they felt absolutely necessary to take with
them, they were overjoyed to find the improvised
raft equal to the task. The rest of the truck
had to be abandoned.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, might as well start, I reckon,&#8221; said
Bob. &#8220;This is the first time I&#8217;ve ever gone in
for an all-day swim. We won&#8217;t really <i>need</i> a
bath the rest of the summer after this.&#8221; Jerry
laughed a reply.</p>

<p>It didn&#8217;t turn out to be so bad as they had
imagined. Shortly after they started the river
grew smoother and shallower, so that wading
was quite possible. During the afternoon of the
next day, with almost startling suddenness they<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90"></a>[90]</span>
found themselves out of the canyon. It ended
almost as surprisingly as it had begun. A
sudden bend through the high cliffs and they
were in the open country.</p>

<p>Bob turned to Jerry and shook his hand.
&#8220;We&#8217;ve done it, old boy. We&#8217;ve beaten the
Labyrinth.&#8221;</p>

<p>In the midst of their mutual congratulations
a hail came to them from the bank. Surprised,
they looked up to see a figure waving to them.
They pulled ashore and found a grizzled old
man standing up beside a camp fire.</p>

<p>&#8220;Did ye come through the gap?&#8221; was his
greeting in a mild, unsurprised tone.</p>

<p>The boys answered in the affirmative. The
old man nodded his head. &#8220;Pretty good, pretty
good. You sho&#8217; surprised me. Only ones what
I&#8217;ve seen come through before have been dead
ones. Sit &#8217;round and in a minute I&#8217;ll have
something to eat for ye.&#8221;</p>

<p>Jerry recognized the type at once. It was a
desert rat, one of those old men who, lured by
the dream of gold, haunt the desert, usually
alone. Years pass over their heads in the
search which never ends. At last the gold mine<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91"></a>[91]</span>
that they will find some day becomes merely the
excuse not the aim of the unending pilgrimage.
The desert, the loneliness is claiming them. If
they found a mine worth the developing,
probably they would sell it and blow in the
proceeds and be off again as soon as possible.
They have been too long away from civilization
for anything to surprise them. The desert is
mysterious, the loneliness makes everything
possible.</p>

<p>The old man&#8217;s meal was sour dough biscuits
and a sort of soup made from jerked beef and
river water. But he offered it to them and
served it as if it were a banquet. To the tired,
hungry boys it <i>was</i> a banquet. They had done
tremendous deeds on a diet of canned goods and
any change was welcome.</p>

<p>The old man ventured no further curiosity in
what they had done. They had come through
the Labyrinth, he had accepted the fact, and
that was all there was to it. He spoke very
little and when the boys asked the way to the
nearest railroad, his answer was given in rather
a relieved tone. It was as if he would be glad
to have the silence to himself again.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92"></a>[92]</span>To the boys&#8217; great joy, they found they had
come out of the canyon at a point only twenty
miles from the railroad. They determined to
hike for it the next day. Before they started
the next morning, Bob had an idea.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s give the old fellow our air mattress.
We won&#8217;t need it any more and maybe he would
like it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Bully,&#8221; agreed Jerry and took it over to
the old man.</p>

<p>They showed him how to blow it up and then
let all the air out and rolled it up into a small
parcel. He was as delighted as a child with a
new toy and thanked them for it. At last they
started out on their hike, carrying with them
only enough food for lunch, the transit and as
much water as possible. When they were about
fifty feet from camp, the old man called out
after them.</p>

<p>&#8220;I forgot to ask what this here thing you
give me might be for.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;To sleep on.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, you&#8217;d better take it back, then,&#8221; he
said. &#8220;I hain&#8217;t slept on nothin&#8217; but the old
earth here for forty year and I reckon I won&#8217;t<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93"></a>[93]</span>
sleep on nothin&#8217; else until I sleep <i>in</i> it. This
here thing ain&#8217;t goin&#8217; to do me no good.&#8221;</p>

<p>The boys laughed and Jerry called back,
&#8220;Well, give it to the burro to sleep on then.&#8221;</p>

<p>With a last wave of the hand, the boys started
on their long hike.</p>

<p>From the river the country had looked flat.
But once faced in the direction the old man had
told them to go, they found the way was quite
hilly. Perhaps they had been so used during
the past days in the canyon to the walls towering
straight up on each side of them that the
gradual rise did seem flat. But they soon
realized it would be quite a climb.</p>

<p>Noon still found them ascending and they
ate their lunch and hurried on. It was sizzling.
There were some trees, but these were few
and far between. Most of the footing was
sandy and made hard walking. Owing to these
conditions it was not until after nightfall that
they saw the first sign of civilization. Bob was
in the lead and was the first to see a reflection
on the horizon.</p>

<p>&#8220;I thought I saw a light ahead, Jerry,&#8221; he
cried. &#8220;Way off there.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94"></a>[94]</span>&#8220;Heat lightning, I guess,&#8221; returned the other,
but before the words were out of his mouth
the same phenomenon occurred and this time
he saw it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Take it all back, Bob; you&#8217;re right. I saw
it too.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But what is it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Reflection from the fire box of an engine
on the smoke that passes over. The reason it
comes in flashes is that it only shows when the
fireman opens the door to pitch on another
scoop of coal. Yes, there it is again!&#8221; They
plodded on, much encouraged.</p>

<p>Jerry had jollied and cheered up Bob during
the long tramp, for Bob, while more adapted to
the water, found himself at a disadvantage
beside his new chum when it came to navigating
the desert. When at last they made the track,
they were footsore and weary. Finishing their
last bit of water, the boys started to walk the
ties in the direction they thought the nearest
station must be. But after a few steps Bob
refused to go farther.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t care what you do,&#8221; he announced to
Jerry, &#8220;but I stop right here, and unless you<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_95"></a>[95]</span>
give me a shove off the track I probably will
sleep right between the rails. The morning will
be plenty soon enough for me to go on, hungry
as I am.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I won&#8217;t argue with you,&#8221; said Jerry. &#8220;And
I guess the sand will seem just about as comfortable
as any feather bed could, the way I
feel. I&#8217;m right with you.&#8221;</p>

<p>The intense desert sun, however, woke them
early to the realization of their weary muscles.
Bob was up first and disturbed Jerry&#8217;s slumbers
by a sudden peal of laughter.</p>

<p>Drowsily Jerry demanded, &#8220;What&#8217;s so all-fired
funny, you early bird?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Get up and look,&#8221; giggled Bob.</p>

<p>The other scrambled to his feet and, blinkingly,
scanned the horizon. Not more than a
quarter of a mile away was a water tank and a
few houses! The night had been so dark and
they had come to the railroad so late that all the
lights had been extinguished in the settlement.
But as far as they were concerned, the town
might just as well have been ten miles away
instead of the few yards it was in reality.</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess it was a good one on us, all right,&#8221;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_96"></a>[96]</span>
Jerry had to admit. &#8220;Come on and we&#8217;ll see
if we can rustle up some breakfast. Also a
wash up. We must be two awful looking
sights.&#8221;</p>

<p>They found something to eat and water to
wash in and felt ten times better.</p>

<p>No questions were asked them. Evidently
they were taken for tramps who had a little
money.</p>

<p>They decided they might just as well find out
if there was any news from Whiskers before
they made any move, so they telegraphed to the
Grand Canyon, asking that any telegram that
had come be forwarded on to them. Then they
proceeded to loaf until the answer arrived.</p>

<p>&#8220;Gee, this is bully,&#8221; commented Bob, as he
lay stretched out on the porch of the general
store, out of the glare of the sun. &#8220;I never
thought just resting could be such fun!&#8221;</p>

<p>Jerry grunted an assent, too lazy to return
a remark.</p>

<p>Neither boy had the energy to lift a finger.
They were dead tired and the mere fact of doing
nothing was infinitely enjoyable. They had a
whole day of this, for it was not until the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_97"></a>[97]</span>
following morning that an answer came to their
wire. It proved to be from the Boss and had
been sent from Washington.</p>

<p>&#8220;Be at Las Cruces on June 20.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve just got time to make it,&#8221; said Jerry.
&#8220;That was sent three days ago and right now
Mr. Whitney ought to be pulling out of Kansas
City. We&#8217;ll catch the local out and be there
just before he arrives.&#8221;</p>

THE PROJECT</h2>
</div>

<p>&#8220;Well, fellows, what&#8217;d you do with yourselves
while I was away? Must have been pretty
tiresome up at the Canyon, wasn&#8217;t it?&#8221; It was
Mr. Whitney talking. He had told them that
his trip to Washington had been a great success.
They had sent for him to put him in charge of
finishing up the big Rio Grande project.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s great!&#8221; said Jerry, who had experience
enough to know that a great honor had
been conferred on his Chief. The Rio Grande
project was the biggest thing the Service had
yet attempted and to be in charge of it was
equivalent to a high promotion.</p>

<p>Bob Hazard knew from Jerry&#8217;s spontaneous
outburst that Mr. Whitney was to be congratulated,
so he made a little speech.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thanks, fellows, thanks,&#8221; laughed the
Chief. &#8220;It will be fine for all of us. But that&#8217;s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99"></a>[99]</span>
enough of my news&mdash;what have you chaps
been up to? Been bored?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, we found plenty to do,&#8221; said Jerry.</p>

<p>&#8220;At the Canyon?&#8221; asked Mr. Whitney. &#8220;I
don&#8217;t see how you could. It is a pretty dreary
place, if you have to be there long.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But we weren&#8217;t at the Canyon,&#8221; put in Bob.</p>

<p>&#8220;So? You surprise me. But wherever you
were, I bet you were in mischief. Just from
the look of you two, I can see that you were up
to some devilment. Besides, you&#8217;re almost
boiling over with the desire to tell me about it.
Come on, out with it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We went through the Labyrinth Canyon,&#8221;
said Jerry calmly.</p>

<p>This news made Steve Whitney jump out of
his chair. &#8220;What!&#8221; he cried. &#8220;You went
through the Labyrinth? You&#8217;re joking.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not at all,&#8221; said Bob calmly. &#8220;We got
tired of doing nothing and we went up the
Green River and went through it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But&mdash;but nobody&#8217;s ever gone through
alive,&#8221; stammered the man. &#8220;I&#8217;ve always
wanted to try it myself but never found the
chance. How did you do it?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_100"></a>[100]</span>&#8220;Boat partly and swimming,&#8221; returned Jerry,
anxious to state the exact facts.</p>

<p>&#8220;But didn&#8217;t you have an awful time?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, it wasn&#8217;t so bad,&#8221; said Bob. &#8220;Once or
twice we had a little trouble but all in all it was
just fun. And the reason we went was because
Jerry thought there might possibly be a project
there.&#8221;</p>

<p>The calm way in which the boys announced
their feat forced Whiskers to believe what at
first glance seemed to be a preposterous yarn.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sure proud of you two,&#8221; he said
warmly. &#8220;But I ought not to be. It was a
foolhardy thing to do and if you had asked my
permission I certainly would not have given it.&#8221;
But as he reproved them his eyes glistened with
the pride he felt. &#8220;I want to hear all about it,
but first tell me, did you find a place where you
think a dam could be built? There is a wonderful
valley out there ready to spring into life if
we only could get water to it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You bet we found a place,&#8221; said Jerry.
&#8220;The dam is already half built by nature.
Besides, I feel sure a road can be made down
from the top of the canyon.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_101"></a>[101]</span>&#8220;That&#8217;s great!&#8221; said Steve Whitney. &#8220;Now
go ahead and spin me the whole yarn.&#8221;</p>

<p>Jerry let Bob tell of their adventure, putting
in a word here and there. But when it came
to the part where Bob had saved his life after
dropping over the waterfall, he took the narrative
in his own hands and in spite of Bob&#8217;s
protests, told the Chief the whole story of the
rescue.</p>

<p>When they had finished, Mr. Whitney was
very much excited. &#8220;We&#8217;ll have to make a
report of your find to Washington at once and,
if possible, get a bill brought up in the next
Congress to authorize us to make a preliminary
survey. We can do it next summer.&#8221;</p>

<p>That their discovery had a good chance of
being acted upon, was a big measure of reward
to the two boys. Mr. Whitney&#8217;s interest
seemed to settle the matter.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&mdash;you think Congress will authorize
it?&#8221; ventured Bob, just to make sure.</p>

<p>&#8220;They will have to!&#8221; was the confident reply.
&#8220;I&#8217;ll draw up a report the moment we strike
camp! But now we&#8217;ll have to run for our train.
I&#8217;ve been so interested, I forgot the time.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_102"></a>[102]</span>The trip passed quickly for Bob and his Chief.
Mr. Whitney was on his way to the biggest
job he had yet tackled, and Bob would taste
for the first time the flavor of the work he felt
he most wanted to do. To Jerry, however, the
train was only bringing him to a new spell of
hard labor.</p>

<p>When at last the jolting cars stopped, they
found a car waiting, into which the three piled.
Once under way, Bob asked Mr. Whitney,
&#8220;Doesn&#8217;t the railroad go into the camp? It
seems to me it must be pretty heavy hauling all
the big machinery from here across the desert.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A railroad goes to the job all right, Bob,
but it&#8217;s meant for freight and a train runs only
three times a week. The line was built by the
Service and belongs to the Government. We&#8217;ve
come the wrong day to catch that train.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I see. And does the Service build other
things besides dams and railroads?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Surely! On a job like this so far away
from any regular transportation line the Service
has to construct all the necessities of life&mdash;and
some luxuries. It built the town that we&#8217;ll be
coming to shortly, put in the electric light system,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_103"></a>[103]</span>
erected a school and a hospital. In some
places we&#8217;ve even built a motion picture theatre
to keep the men satisfied. Probably there&#8217;s one
on this job. When I was up here last they
were planning it. I bet you never thought Uncle
Sam was in the amusement business.&#8221;</p>

<p>Bob laughed. &#8220;There sure must be a lot of
men working up there.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a young city. But here we are.&#8221;</p>

<p>The road had been steadily climbing and now
it topped the crest of the hill. Before their eyes
lay a wonderful panorama. To the north, the
wide valley of the river stretched into the distance,
a winding band of green and gold, flanked
on each side by the glowing desert. Immediately
below them the peaceful face of nature
was broken.</p>

<p>It was the place where the dam was to be
built&mdash;where already part of it was built. From
the height from which they looked the network
of cables and railroad tracks and rushing ant-like
figures, seemed a confused jumble without
a sense of direction. But as the car coasted
down the well-made road&mdash;also constructed
by the Government, Bob learned later&mdash;the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_104"></a>[104]</span>
jumble became clearer. The cables, extending
from one side of the hill to the other, carried
buckets which rushed incessantly to and fro.
These were lowered and hoisted seemingly by
chance. The puffing engines pulled cars of
rock to the crusher and backed away for new
loads. The swarming men now showed themselves
as workers, the directing units, and their
rushing about was merely carrying out their
part of the great work.</p>

<p>Finally the car came to a stop before a large
two-story adobe house. The boys followed Mr.
Whitney inside. &#8220;This is the Quarter-house,&#8221;
Mr. Whitney explained as they went in. &#8220;They
have rooms here for the engineering force and
it is also used as a hotel if any guests happen
to come along. I&#8217;ll see if you boys can be put
up here until we can find permanent quarters
for you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hardly were they over the threshhold, before
a short, stocky, middle-aged man came up to
them. He rushed up to Whitney with outstretched
hands and said, &#8220;I certainly am glad
to see you, Whitney. Ted Adams has been gone
two weeks and I have been expecting you almost<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_105"></a>[105]</span>
any day. I couldn&#8217;t get down to meet you at
the station, as they needed me over at the spillway.
Little matter of extra shoring. It&#8217;s all
right now.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Chief shook the other man&#8217;s hand warmly.
&#8220;You&#8217;re staying on, aren&#8217;t you, Taylor?&#8221; And
when the other nodded his assent, he continued,
&#8220;I&#8217;m glad! Couldn&#8217;t have better luck! I was
hoping that you would stick as my assistant.
My first job for you is to find jobs for a couple
of rodmen I brought along with me. Here,
boys, I want to introduce you to Mr. Taylor,
the assistant engineer and therefore your
immediate boss.&#8221;</p>

<p>Taylor had flushed at Mr. Whitney&#8217;s words
of confidence. It was easy to see that he would
probably always be an assistant, never a full-fledged
chief. He was the kind of man who could
execute orders perfectly but when left with the
responsibility of making decisions for himself,
was likely to become flustered and upset. He
took refuge in the inquiry about the boys.</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;ll be plenty of work for &#8217;em. It happens
we&#8217;re a little short on rodmen just now.
But about sleeping quarters&mdash;I&#8217;ve got your<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_106"></a>[106]</span>
house ready for you, Whitney, and as soon as
your dunnage comes along you can move right
in,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s fine,&#8221; returned Whitney. &#8220;But the
boys&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, there&#8217;s room here for the time being.
We can see about something else later. But
you must be famished. Come along to my shack.
It&#8217;s about supper time. You come too, fellows.
The regular mess is over.&#8221;</p>

<p>Both Bob and Jerry were overjoyed at the
invitation. The long trip had made them hungry
and they rather wondered where their supper
would come from. Mr. Taylor waited until they
had taken their suit cases up to the room that
had been assigned them and then the little group
walked up the street to the cottage that was the
assistant engineer&#8217;s. His wife, a pleasant-faced
woman, welcomed them and seemed especially
pleased to see Whitney. Bob realized that his
friend evidently was a great favorite and had
made many friends during his years in the
Service.</p>

<p>Mrs. Taylor had prepared what seemed to
Bob an especially fine supper, considering that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_107"></a>[107]</span>
they were miles away from civilization. During
a lull in the conversation he mentioned it. She
was much pleased.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, New York has very little on us up here,&#8221;
she said. &#8220;What with a cold storage plant
and an ice factory, we don&#8217;t want for anything.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was so. In this frontier camp practically
all the comforts that the civilization of a city
could give were present: electric lights, ice,
excellent stores&mdash;and the movie theatre. It
was like transplanting a little corner of a city.</p>

<p>After supper they went out on the porch
from which could be seen the works. Dusk
had come during the meal and already the stars
shone pale in the sky. Down at their feet vague
outlines of the excavations could be seen, the
darker shadows marking their extent. Down to
the left was a cluster of bright lights.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is that?&#8221; Bob asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;The town,&#8221; was the answer; &#8220;the mechanics&#8217;
houses and the bunk houses for the Mexican
laborers. The only people who live up here on
the hill are the engineers and executives.&#8221;</p>

<p>When the men got their cigars lighted they
began to talk. Whitney was of course anxious<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_108"></a>[108]</span>
to know what the situation was on the job he
was to tackle in the morning. If the laborers
were satisfied, how the work was progressing,
and a thousand and one other things he needed
to know bubbled forth. The assistant engineer
was a veritable mine of information. Practically
every question was answered without a
moment&#8217;s hesitation. Bob was contented to sit
and listen, drinking in all the information he
could. This was the Reclamation Service and
to-morrow would see him taking an active part
in the work.</p>

BOB&#8217;S CHANCE</h2>
</div>

<p>To Bob&#8217;s great disgust his first job was not
out on the construction work. Whiskers had
turned him over to Mr. Taylor, who set him to
work in the draughting room. All day long he
sat on a stool, and did simple sums: endless
multiplications and divisions of figures that
came from the blue prints made by the engineers.
It was stupid work and had in it little of the
romance which he had always associated with
the work he was to do. However, he comforted
himself with the thought that if it were not
necessary, the Chief would never set him at it.</p>

<p>Jerry, on account of his experience, had at
once been assigned to active outside work as
the aid of one of the many junior assistant
engineers. At night he would tell Bob of the
day&#8217;s work and commiserate with him that his
lot was not as exciting. But at lunch hour and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_110"></a>[110]</span>
after work was over for the day, Bob found
a chance to investigate the outside work. It
was fascinating. Along one side of the valley
the river had been forced by means of a temporary
dam into an artificial channel, called the
spillway, so that the river bottom where the
dam was to be built should be clear of water.
From the river bed rose the rough foundations
of the permanent dam.</p>

<p>It was like a giant staircase on the side which
would not come against the water. It was about
half finished when Bob first got there, but each
day it rose steadily higher and higher. Bob
examined it all. Each operation he came to
fascinated him, and by using his eyes he soon
grew to understand much of the method by
which results were achieved.</p>

<p>It was weeks before there came a break in
the monotony of his work. He had forced
himself to be cheerful about his stupid job and
not to show by the least sign that he was not
entirely content with the work he had been set
to do. Mr. Taylor, who since the advent of the
Chief, had taken charge of the office work,
spoke to Mr. Whitney. &#8220;That boy, Hazard,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_111"></a>[111]</span>
is a good lad,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Although the plucky
beggar won&#8217;t own up, I think he is eating his
heart out at the draughting board. I can get
along without him, so give him a chance outside
if you can.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A little office work won&#8217;t do him any harm,&#8221;
commented Mr. Whitney. &#8220;I asked you to put
him to work there on purpose. I don&#8217;t want him
to get too inflated an idea of the romance of
engineering. But I&#8217;ll remember what you said
and if something turns up I&#8217;ll see what I can
do.&#8221;</p>

<p>The time was to come sooner than either
Taylor or Whitney expected. The Chief
Engineer had been so busy familiarizing himself
with all the details of the outside work
that he had spent little time in the office and
so had not often seen Bob. Not an activity,
from the operation of the railway branch to
the pouring of a new batch of concrete on the
dam itself, had escaped his inspection. He
wanted to know all the foremen of the different
gangs, to size them up, and to gain their personal
loyalty. The long experience he had had in
bossing men, taught him that being human and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_112"></a>[112]</span>
approachable did not impair discipline. Besides,
in times of emergency, the men could be more
counted on.</p>

<p>From the men with whom he came into contact,
Bob Hazard realized that his boss was
rapidly becoming very popular. Every one was
singing his praises and the general feeling was
that the work was going ahead at a pace never
equalled under the preceding engineers. All
this was pleasing to the boy who had idolized the
man, and helped him to be content with the work
at which he had been placed.</p>

<p>It was not of course the sort of life he had
pictured. That had been rather a vague idea
of khaki-clad figures, perched with their instruments
on perilous peaks and over yawning
chasms; and a general idea of romance had run
through his dreams. To be put into an office
to do sums was little better than going to
school. That his drawing board faced a window
below which the job spread out, was a help,
for while his mind mechanically did the figuring
that was necessary, he could imagine himself
out on the work mingling with the crowd.</p>

<p>One part of the activity drew him especially.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_113"></a>[113]</span>
This was the cableway system. Between the
towers set up on the high ground on each side
of the river, the strands of wire rope were
suspended. Along them ran great pulleys from
which the buckets hung. The buckets would
flash across Bob&#8217;s vision endlessly, carrying
loads of mixed concrete, of sand, of anything
that was needed.</p>

<p>Their flight was swift, swooping something
like a bird&#8217;s. From one tower the bucket would
speed, only to stop silently and, almost before
its crossways movement had ended, it would
drop to the surface of the work. An instant
to unload the bucket and in a flash it was up
and gliding like the wind back to its starting
point.</p>

<p>There was something so fascinating, so
rhythmical in this operation, that Bob had difficulty
in tearing his eyes away and concentrating
on his work.</p>

<p>One morning, however, something new occurred
to distract his attention. Happening to
glance out of the window, he saw Jerry coming
up the path to the office, running with all the
speed of which he was capable.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_114"></a>[114]</span>The door of the draughting room was open
into the hall where the telephone central was
seated. Her job was trying to keep in touch
with all the different division chiefs so that
they might be found if any emergency should
occur. Therefore Bob knew that he would hear
what was the cause of this especial emergency
that had galvanized Jerry into such a tremendous
haste.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Chief!&#8221; he heard Jerry pant as the
footsteps ended in the hall. &#8220;Where is he?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mixer last!&#8221; snapped the girl, plugging in
and ringing her call at the same time. &#8220;I&#8217;ll see
if he&#8217;s still there!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Meantime, where&#8217;s Mr. Taylor? He&#8217;d
help&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t get him&mdash;gone to Las Cruces. Yes,
hello, Mixer? The Chief? Gone? Yes, yes!
Where? North end spillway! Right! &#8217;Bye.&#8221;
She pulled out the plug and said to Jerry,
&#8220;Started for spillway ten minutes ago. No
phone there yet. Take fifteen minutes get messenger
there&mdash;can you wait?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Jerry. &#8220;Mr. Rutherford, my
chief, wants him. Wall of auxiliary spillway<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_115"></a>[115]</span>
this side of the river giving way&mdash;will flood all
the buttress excavation. We&#8217;re shoring it, but
Mr. Rutherford wants the Chief and in a hurry.
I&#8217;m off but I&#8217;m afraid I&#8217;ll get him too late! If
he calls up send him to Mr. Rutherford at
once!&#8221; With this Jerry shot out of the office
and down the hill, evidently planning to make
his legs take him to the Chief.</p>

<p>Inside, Bob had been listening with wide open
ears and his mind pictured the scene Jerry had
left to find Mr. Whitney and filled out the holes
the winded boy had left in his description. He
knew the auxiliary spillway and the harm it
could do if it should fail to carry its burden.
It was a temporary affair of wood to be used
only until a system of drains could be built to
take care of the excess water that collected
below the coffer dam. His mind&#8217;s eye saw
Rutherford and Jerry at the dangerous place:
Rutherford, young and inexperienced, doing
what he could to avert disaster, but rattled,
probably badly so. He wanted Mr. Whitney or
somebody with practical knowledge and he had
sent Jerry off to bring help. All Bob could do
was to hope that the wall would hold.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_116"></a>[116]</span>Reluctantly he started to take up his dreary
work but on the way to the board, his eyes
glanced through the window and rested on a
grab bucket that was speeding through the air.
For a second the sight meant nothing special to
him, then suddenly it brought him to his feet.
Without a word to the other draughtsmen he
dashed out of the room, not waiting to snatch his
cap.</p>

<p>A plan had come to him in a flash. Whitney
was needed and needed in a hurry. He was on
the other side of the river valley at the head of
the spillway. The opposite cableway tower over
there was near this spot&mdash;if the buckets could
go over, couldn&#8217;t he? He&#8217;d try anyway!</p>

<p>With all the speed he could muster he ran
towards the cable tower, thanking his stars that
the control station was on this side of the
river, and that he knew one of the lever men.
It was this fellow&#8217;s job to dispatch the buckets
and hoist and lower them.</p>

<p>&#8220;Trouble below, Billy!&#8221; gasped Bob as he
came to the shed that protected the operator
from the rays of the sun. &#8220;Need the Big Boss.
He&#8217;s over at the spillway. Shoot me over?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_117"></a>[117]</span>&#8220;&#8217;Gainst rules, son,&#8221; was the man&#8217;s answer,
pulling a lever which made a great bucket shoot
up from the depths.</p>

<p>&#8220;But this&mdash;this is serious,&#8221; cried the boy.
&#8220;Rules don&#8217;t count! They&#8217;ve got to have him!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sorry,&#8221; was the short response, &#8220;but orders
are orders. Nothing doing.&#8221;</p>

<p>Bob continued to waste a few precious seconds
in a vain endeavor to move his friend Billy, but
kept his eye on the returning bucket. It came
almost to Billy&#8217;s shed and then, in response to
a sharp jerk on a lever, it dropped into the
mixing shed of the concrete plant.</p>

<p>A way of overcoming this obstacle came to
Bob. Without wasting any more time talking
he rushed down to the concrete shed to get there
just as the loading gang had finished changing
the great hook of the cableway from the empty
bucket to a full one. The foreman had his
hand raised to signal Billy to hoist away when
Bob darted in and jumped onto the bucket.</p>

<p>The foreman was so surprised that involuntarily
his hand made the signal and a second
later Bob was climbing through space, faster
than a rocket!</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_118"></a>[118]</span>The wind whistled in his ears and he was
choked by the rapid ascent, yet the sensation was
not entirely unpleasant. It was like riding in
the fastest elevator he&#8217;d ever been in&mdash;at triple
the speed.</p>

<p>Not until the bucket had reached the height
of the cableway was he able to take any interest
in looking about him. The second or so that
had elapsed since he had taken passage on the
concrete conveyor had been fully occupied in
putting himself in a position where he could
hold on and not be in danger of being tipped
over the side. Worming himself around he
found he could seat himself comfortably in the
hook that held the bucket and clasp his arms
around the great iron ball that hung just under
the many sheaved pulley.</p>

<p>When this was done he ventured a look over
the side. From the attitude of Billy he knew
that the operator had seen him. What would
Billy do? The success of his whole scheme
depended on it. He had figured that the man
would be sport enough to shoot him across if
he had once got on the bucket and was on his
way.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_119"></a>[119]</span>The speed of the bucket slackened as it neared
the cable height and for an agonizing second he
thought that Billy was about to drop him back
to the spot he had started from. It would be
a rotten ending to his adventure, and the whole
camp would have the laugh on him. On a sudden
impulse he disengaged one hand and
motioned that he wanted to go on.</p>

<p>It was a dangerous expedient but it was
worth it, for Billy, resigned to the situation,
waved back and a moment later the bucket
started to swoop towards the other shore.</p>

<p>Bob was facing the way in which they were
going and he was conscious that it was like sliding
down a great hill, for the cable above him
dipped towards the center. There was little
time for thought, however, as the bucket lost
no time in gathering headway. At one moment
it was almost still, the next it was whistling
through the air.</p>

<p>The first down rush was glorious. Not until
he started to climb up the other incline of the
cable did Bob give any thought to the speed
he was making. There was a slight slackening
in the rush through the air, but so quickly was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_120"></a>[120]</span>
the whole journey over that Bob&#8217;s first impression
was the one that he slipped off the
bucket with when it touched ground at the foot
of the west tower.</p>

<p>Billy had been a sport! He had shot Bob just
as far over as he could and the boy was correspondingly
grateful.</p>

<p>The inspection trips he had made outside of
working hours now proved a great help, for he
knew the quickest way to the place the Chief
was supposed to be. Setting out on a run he
was soon there. Mr. Whitney was engaged in
conversation with the foreman but broke off as
the boy rushed up.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the row, Bob?&#8221; he wanted to know.</p>

<p>&#8220;Need you&mdash;quick&mdash;over at the east spillway&mdash;wall
giving way&mdash;&#8221; But faster than
the words could tremble out, the Chief was
acting.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come along,&#8221; he directed. &#8220;Talk as we
go!&#8221;</p>

<p>He made tracks for a dinky engine that was
hitched to a load of empties.</p>

<p>&#8220;Uncouple!&#8221; he yelled to the engineer. As
he and Bob swung into the cab, the little locomotive<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_121"></a>[121]</span>
was already moving slowly. &#8220;To the
east bank, quick!&#8221; he ordered and caught the
whistle cord. The prolonged screech told the
switchmen and other trains that something
serious was afoot, and that the line must be
cleared.</p>

<p>&#8220;Know anything else?&#8221; demanded the Chief
as the engine rocked crazily on the narrow gauge
track, and when Bob shook his head, asked,
&#8220;How did you get over?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Bucket,&#8221; said the boy briefly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good idea,&#8221; commented Mr. Whitney and
was silent until the engine pulled up snorting
as near their destination as it could get. &#8220;Come
along,&#8221; invited Mr. Whitney as he swung off
the engine. Pleased, Bob did his best to keep
up with his long-legged boss who had headed
for the point of trouble with great strides.</p>

<p>It has taken a long time to describe the things
that had happened to Bob since he heard Jerry&#8217;s
predicament in the office, yet the actual time it
had taken him to get Mr. Whitney to the scene
of action was hardly a handful of minutes.
This was proved by the fact that Bob had a
confused belief that halfway back on the little<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_122"></a>[122]</span>
engine he had seen Jerry on his way to find Mr.
Whitney. These thoughts mingled in his brain
as he followed his Chief to the temporary spillway.</p>

<p>Nothing serious had happened so far, he was
glad to see, as they came upon Mr. Rutherford
and the gang of men who were attempting to
shore up the wall of the stream. The waterway
at this point was built entirely of wood and
the present trouble was due either to an unexpected
pressure of water or some defect in
construction.</p>

<p>The gang had been working feverishly and
without much order until Steve Whitney came
on the scene. Bob was amazed at the change
that seemed to take place as soon as his Chief
had uttered a few incisive directions. The rescue
work went on smoothly and efficiently.
There was no panic, no blundering.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here, you men, down stream a bit with
that timber. Rutherford, you&#8217;ve the right idea&mdash;stick
to it. Rush &#8217;em up, boys,&#8221; to a gang
bringing up a supply of planks. &#8220;Have you
diverted any of the water, Rutherford?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, sir, I&mdash;I never thought of&mdash;&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_123"></a>[123]</span>&#8220;You should have!&#8221; This was all the rebuke
the young engineer was to get. Perhaps it was
because Whitney did things that way, that all
his men adored him. He did not think that
because a man made a mistake that he should
be shamed before his fellow workers. He turned
to Bob.</p>

<p>&#8220;Chase up to the dam line. There&#8217;s an overflow
gate in the spillway there. Break it open!&#8221;</p>

<p>Bob hustled off on his errand and found the
place the Chief had designated. A few blows
with a stone and he had loosened the gate sufficiently
to let a big stream of water flow out.</p>

<p>&#8220;What the dickens are you doing?&#8221; yelled
the foreman of a surfacing gang, starting for
the boy on a run. &#8220;Want to flood the works?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Keep your shirt on! Chief&#8217;s orders!&#8221; but
he had to explain the whole matter before the
man realized that he was not an anarchist. The
foreman&#8217;s strength added to his was sufficient
to give the water a clear outlet, and Bob saw
with satisfaction that the body of water passing
down the canal to the weakened spot was considerably
less.</p>

<p>When he reported to the Chief he found that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_124"></a>[124]</span>
all danger was past and the gang at work making
a permanent repair of the damage.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good work,&#8221; said Mr. Whitney as the boy
came up. &#8220;Water slackened just in time.&#8221;
Then he turned to Rutherford.</p>

<p>&#8220;When you finish the shoring, close the gate
immediately.&#8221;</p>

<p>Suddenly Bob remembered that he had left
his job in the office without anybody&#8217;s authority.
The excitement had made him forget that he
had a job. Now, when everything was quiet,
the realization that probably he had been missed
came to him and he started to make tracks in
the general direction of the office. He had not
gone far, however, when he heard a familiar
voice hail him from behind. It was Mr. Whitney,
so he slowed up and turned.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hold on, Bob. I want to speak to you.&#8221;</p>

<p>A moment later Mr. Whitney was beside him,
an expression on his face which the boy could
not fathom. It was a stern look yet there was
a twinkle in the kind eyes. His first words were
ominous.</p>

<p>&#8220;What are you doing away from your drawing
board? Did Mr. Taylor send you for me?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_125"></a>[125]</span>&#8220;No&mdash;no, sir,&#8221; stammered Bob, helplessly.
&#8220;He wasn&#8217;t there&mdash;he&#8217;s in Las Cruces&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And you came across the river on the cableway,
didn&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, sir. It was the only&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No excuses! It means that you have broken
discipline twice, doesn&#8217;t it? Left your work
and then rode a bucket, which is against all
orders. I&#8217;ll have to fire that control operator
who let you do it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He couldn&#8217;t help it!&#8221; cried the boy, horrified
that what he had done might get someone else
into trouble. &#8220;I jumped the bucket in the mixing
plant and I was halfway across before
Billy ever saw me!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So that&#8217;s how you did it!&#8221; ejaculated the
Chief. &#8220;In that case I may not have to do
more than reprimand Billy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s fine!&#8221; said the much relieved boy.</p>

<p>&#8220;But as for you&mdash;I must punish you much
more severely,&#8221; the twinkle in the man&#8217;s eyes
grew more pronounced, and in spite of himself
he smiled. &#8220;You are sentenced to be <i>my</i> rodman,
to stay with me all the time we&#8217;re on the
job.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_126"></a>[126]</span>&#8220;Gee whiz!&#8221; whistled Bob, the suddenness
of the turn the talk had taken amazing him.
&#8220;Then&mdash;then what I did was right?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You bet it was! Both right and plucky.
I&#8217;m proud of you&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And I&#8217;m going to be on your own corps?
This is too much,&#8221; and the boy laughed
happily.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, Bob,&#8221; said Steve Whitney seriously,
&#8220;I want someone on whom I can rely to think
quickly and not lose his head in an emergency.
Rules and regulations must be broken when the
jam is tight enough&mdash;and many tight jams
occur in the Service. You proved to-day that you
used your brains and were plucky enough to
act on what your brain told you to do. Probably
the few minutes you saved in getting me,
were worth thousands of dollars to the Service
and days of delay. If that spillway wall had
broken, the buttress excavations would have
filled and all the digging work would have had
to be done over.&#8221;</p>

<p>Before Bob could stammer his thanks, the
Chief continued, &#8220;Report to me in the morning.
Better go back now and finish up your work.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_127"></a>[127]</span>The conversation had taken place as they
climbed the hill to the Upper Town. Now, Mr.
Whitney went off in the direction of his cottage,
and Bob to the office.</p>

<p>That night Jerry came in late to the room
that he still shared with Bob.</p>

<p>&#8220;Lucky stiff!&#8221; he said pleasantly. &#8220;Beat me
to it, didn&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Reckon so,&#8221; grinned Bob happily. &#8220;Sore?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not a bit&mdash;only wish I&#8217;d thought of it.
Was the old man pleased?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He made me his rodman, if that&#8217;s any sign.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You <i>are</i> lucky but I&#8217;m mighty glad for you.
It&#8217;ll be a heap more fun than that office work.&#8221;</p>

<p>Bob thought he detected a little note of disappointment
in his chum&#8217;s tone, but the words
of congratulation seemed sincere.</p>

<p>&#8220;It will be your turn next,&#8221; said Bob as
they turned off the light.</p>

THE DAM</h2>
</div>

<p>&#8220;So you want me to tell you something about
the dam?&#8221; said Mr. Whitney, smiling at his
rodman. The two were sitting on the side of
a hill overlooking the construction work several
days after Bob had been promoted from the
office to the proud position of being the Chief&#8217;s
aide. He had been on a message to the cofferdam
gang and had returned to find the boss
seemingly loafing. When he saw there might
be a few free moments before he was set to
work again he ventured some questions regarding
the thing that was of most interest to him.</p>

<p>The way Mr. Whitney answered was encouraging,
so Bob came back, &#8220;Yes, sir, I&#8217;d
like to know a lot more about it than I do. Anything
you tell me is going to help. I&#8217;ve picked
up a little here and there and know some of the
details but I don&#8217;t really know anything about<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_129"></a>[129]</span>
the general plan. Wasn&#8217;t there any irrigation
on the Rio Grande before the Reclamation
Service took hold?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Indeed there was,&#8221; was the answer. &#8220;The
Indians were the first irrigators. The Pueblo
or village Indians, as they were called, while it
was in a crude way, irrigated all the land on
which they raised corn. They were the first
settlers of the Rio Grande Valley. We know
this is so, for one of the Spanish Conquistadores,
Coronado by name, wrote it down in the record
of his travels. When he marched from the
south into what is now New Mexico in search
of the gold which was the aim and hope of all
the adventurers of his time, he found the Indians
irrigating the land by means of crude ditches
dug with their primitive implements. This was
the first record we have, but it has been established
beyond any reasonable doubt that such
irrigation as he found was practiced here by
this river that flows below us long before
Columbus discovered America. The theory is
that in all probability irrigation along the Rio
Grande was in vogue even before the Egyptians
used the waters of the Nile for the same purpose.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_130"></a>[130]</span>
When the first Spanish settlers came along, and
later the Americans, they adopted the same
methods of making the ground productive as
had the Indians. All we have done as time
went on is to improve the general principles
taken from the savages. Of course, as we made
better tools, we have been able to build larger
ditches and so increase the area of fertile land
far beyond the dreams of the Indians.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But, Mr. Whitney,&#8221; Bob put in, &#8220;if irrigation
was such a success, why weren&#8217;t more
canals constructed before the Government took
hold of the job?&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Whitney laughed. &#8220;The greatest drawback
was a ridiculous thing. A long time ago
a treaty was made with Mexico which prohibited
the storing of flood water on the Rio
Grande and it&#8217;s the flood water that is used in
modern irrigation.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But how would that hurt the Mexicans?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The reason given was that the lack of water
would interfere with navigation, but when you
realize that it isn&#8217;t until the Rio Grande flows
a thousand miles on the other side of the Mexican
boundary that any navigation begins, you<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_131"></a>[131]</span>
can see how ridiculous <i>that</i> objection was. We
were able to get this treaty broken at last and
have substituted a new one in its place. Under
this new treaty we guarantee to deliver to
Mexico a certain minimum number of gallons
of water a year and we are at liberty to do
what we like with the remainder. By building
this dam we will give Mexico only one-tenth
of the total amount stored each year, yet that
one-tenth is more than half as much again as
they are getting now!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That new treaty clears up the biggest
trouble, then, doesn&#8217;t it?&#8221; said Bob. &#8220;But in
the early days of settlement I wouldn&#8217;t have
thought that the Mexicans would have enforced
the old treaty.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t suppose they could,&#8221; returned Mr.
Whitney, &#8220;but the uncertainty kept many a
prospective irrigator from spending his time or
energy in the work. Now, however, even
Mexico is strong for the completion of the big
dam, as it will irrigate a lot of her land which
before was desert. Besides, it will cost them
nothing and that always appeals to folks&mdash;including
Mexicans!&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_132"></a>[132]</span>&#8220;It certainly is going to be some big dam,&#8221;
said Bob, waving his hand over the work spread
out below them. &#8220;How high is it going to be?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If I remember the figures exactly, it will
be two hundred and twenty-five feet from the
foundation to the top&mdash;almost as tall as the
Flatiron Building in New York. It will be
nearly twelve hundred feet from bank to bank
across the top.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It will have to be awfully thick, won&#8217;t it,
to be able to hold the water?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;ll be twenty feet through at the top. At
the bottom it has to be pretty nearly two hundred
feet. Although it is all filled in now by
masonry, they had to dig down to bedrock and
to get there they had to excavate about five
hundred and fifty thousand cubic yards of sand,
shale and rock. It&#8217;s sixty-five feet from the
river bed to the bottom of the foundation.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That must&#8217;ve been some job. I wish we
had been here to do it, don&#8217;t you, Mr.
Whitney?&#8221;</p>

<p>The man smiled at the boy&#8217;s eagerness.
&#8220;There will be other jobs for us to do,&#8221; he
said, &#8220;where we&#8217;ll go through with it from the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_133"></a>[133]</span>
start to the finish. I wouldn&#8217;t be a bit surprised
if about the time you have graduated from
college we would be ready to begin work on the
Labyrinth which you and Jerry found. You&#8217;ll
come out to be my chief assistant and we&#8217;ll do
the whole thing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;ll be great,&#8221; said Bob, his face glowing.
&#8220;But go ahead about this dam. I&#8217;m
learning more than I have all the time I&#8217;ve been
here poking around by myself. It ought to make
a pretty big lake when once the water is dammed
up, shouldn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You bet,&#8221; said Mr. Whitney. &#8220;The lake
will be forty miles long, and if you started to
walk around it, keeping directly on the shore
line, you would have covered two hundred miles
before you could get to your starting point. If
the water it will hold was spread out one foot
deep, it would cover nearly five thousand miles
or about twice the size of the State of Delaware.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And how many gallons will it hold?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There will be so many that we have found
it easier to figure in what we call acre feet.
The gallon figures are too cumbersome. An acre<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_134"></a>[134]</span>
foot is the amount of water that would be sufficient
to cover an acre one foot deep.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And the water of the reservoir would cover
how many acres?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Two million at least,&#8221; he answered. &#8220;In
gallons that would be something around nine-hundred
billion gallons. So you can see how
much easier it is to figure in acre feet.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I should say so,&#8221; said Bob. &#8220;But it must
cost a fortune to construct all this. Do you
know about how much?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The estimate for the dam itself is five million,
three hundred thousand dollars, and the
canals and other expenses will bring the entire
cost up to over seven million.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Gee, how will the farmers ever pay that off?
Didn&#8217;t you tell me that the money was only
advanced by the Government and that the
farmers would have to return it after the water
is delivered to them?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I did,&#8221; said Mr. Whitney, &#8220;but as the dam
will furnish enough water to irrigate one hundred
and eighty thousand acres, you see that
brings the cost down to about forty dollars an
acre, which won&#8217;t be much once it is all under<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_135"></a>[135]</span>
cultivation. This charge is like a mortgage&mdash;the
Government is secured by the land itself.
But it won&#8217;t be long now&mdash;two or three years
at the outside&mdash;before the dam is finished and
the land is ready to be cultivated. Ted Adams,
my predecessor here, finished up a diversion dam
below at Leesburg which has been a help.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What a wonderful thing it is,&#8221; Bob said at
last.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; he said, &#8220;it is wonderful. Centuries
of primitive irrigation have furnished the knowledge
which has made this dam possible. It is
the greatest irrigation scheme ever attempted
and I am proud that it is to be my lot to finish
it&mdash;mighty proud.&#8221; His eyes were on the
swarming crowd of men, the cable wires humming,
the derricks shifting their burdens, all
the myriad activities that went to the building
of <i>his</i> dam. &#8220;It will be a dream fulfilled,&#8221; he
said almost to himself. Then, suddenly, he
knocked the ashes from his pipe and got up.
&#8220;Come, Bob,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We must get on the
job. We&#8217;re not bringing the finish along any
quicker by sitting here dreaming of it.&#8221;</p>

TED HOYT</h2>
</div>

<p>Two or three Sundays after they had come to
the dam, Bob and Jerry found themselves with
a day on their hands.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come on, Bob, let&#8217;s get a couple of horses
and ride up into the range country. I hear
there are some wonderful ranches farther up
country.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Bob. &#8220;I&#8217;ll stick to the water. I
found a canoe and I am just aching to do some
paddling. Come on with me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Didn&#8217;t you get enough water in the Labyrinth?&#8221;
laughed Jerry.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ll ever get enough water,&#8221;
returned Bob. &#8220;Are you coming?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I reckon I&#8217;ll let you go alone. Me for
the high places!&#8221;</p>

<p>So the two boys spent their Sunday apart.
The canoe had belonged to one of the engineers<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_137"></a>[137]</span>
who had left for another project, and the storekeeper
who had bought it was willing to rent
it out. Bob decided to go down stream the first
day and take a look at the land which would
be irrigated by the water stored up by the dam
when it was finished. He took his lunch with
him as he expected to make an all day trip
of it.</p>

<p>Soon after leaving civilization the river broadened
out into a shallow slow-moving stream.
Bob lay back in the canoe and merely paddled
sufficiently to steer it, letting the lazy current
carry him slowly along. Close to the river bank
everything was green and fresh looking, but
this vegetation did not extend so far that Bob
could not see where the green left off and the
desert began.</p>

<p>His mind&#8217;s eye pictured the network of
canals that would run off on each side and
which, by bringing that magic thing, water, to
the parched earth, would transform it into
fruitful acres. Once around a bend from the
dam he was alone in the immense country. Not
a vestige of human occupancy could be seen.
The desert stretched way out on either side,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_138"></a>[138]</span>
broken here and there by hills, or buttes, as
they are called.</p>

<p>Therefore, when he saw in the distance a
figure seated on a rock fishing, it came as a great
surprise. He pointed the canoe&#8217;s nose toward
the fisherman. When he got close he saw that
it was a boy of perhaps his own age.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hello,&#8221; said the stranger as he grew nearer.
&#8220;Where you from? The dam?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yep,&#8221; answered Bob.</p>

<p>&#8220;But what are you doing down here?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Just out on a little jaunt. Where did you
come from?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I live over the hill there,&#8221; answered the
other boy. &#8220;Dad&#8217;s a stock raiser. You can
see the house from the river after you get down
a little further. I sneaked away from my old
man this morning to see if I could get a few
fish. They aren&#8217;t biting very good here,
though,&#8221; he concluded. &#8220;I wish I had a boat,
because I know of a peach of a place&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Come along with me then,&#8221; suggested Bob.
&#8220;I would be tickled to death to have company,
especially if you&#8217;ve got another line and plenty
of bait.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_139"></a>[139]</span>&#8220;Sure Mike!&#8221; said the other boy. &#8220;I&#8217;m with
you.&#8221; And he stepped gingerly into the canoe.
The newcomer did not seem particularly familiar
with the easily capsized craft, yet Bob noted
with satisfaction that he had sense enough to
keep very quiet once he was aboard.</p>

<p>As Bob shot out into the stream he asked the
newcomer, &#8220;Want to paddle?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t know much about it, to tell you the
truth. All the boatin&#8217; I&#8217;ve done was in a flat
bottomed scow I had up to the last flood. The
high water swiped it on me and I reckon the
Mexicans have got it by now,&#8221; he grinned. &#8220;I
felt pretty sore about losing it, but my Dad
figured it was good business. Said I spent too
much time on the river anyhow; that I ought
to be out riding range for him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Cowboy?&#8221; said Bob, at once interested by
the two magic words &#8220;riding range.&#8221; He had
met them in many books of adventure. They
brought up thoughts of bucking bronchos, fights
with Indians, and all the rest of the romance of
the West. That this boy of about his own age
could be a cowboy was really exciting. But he
missed the woolly chaps and the sombrero. The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_140"></a>[140]</span>
boy was simply dressed in overalls, went barefooted
and wore a heavy slouch hat.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nope,&#8221; said the other. &#8220;Dad don&#8217;t want
me to be a cowboy. I wouldn&#8217;t mind that much.
He wants me to be a farm hand! Nix on that!
I wish I could go up to the dam. That&#8217;s regular
work. Reckon I could get a job up there?&#8221;</p>

<p>Bob did not know what to say. Mr. Whitney
had given him the feeling that for anyone who
was really enthusiastic about the Service, the
Service had room. But he thought he had
better not be too encouraging. &#8220;Why don&#8217;t you
come up and try? I&#8217;ll introduce you to the
Boss.&#8221;</p>

<p>The other boy laughed. &#8220;My old man would
whale the tar out of me if he caught me monkeying
around up there.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Doesn&#8217;t your father believe in the project?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s a cattleman,&#8221; said the boy, as if that
explained everything.</p>

<p>&#8220;But what difference does that make?&#8221; insisted
Bob. &#8220;He ought to be glad to see the
dam built!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You must be a tenderfoot,&#8221; the other said
pityingly. &#8220;It&#8217;s this way. My father raises<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_141"></a>[141]</span>
cattle. For cattle, you need the range on which
they feed and which has been free to all. About
all the range there is around here is along the
banks of the river. Now this irrigation business
comes along and the Government won&#8217;t let anybody
have more than 160 acres of land. Then
my Dad has got to get rid of all his cattle and
go to farmin&#8217;&mdash;which is pretty nigh as disgraceful
for a cattleman as sheep-keeping. That
is, of course, if he wants to stay around this
part of the country.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I see,&#8221; said Bob. &#8220;Then he&#8217;s got a real
reason for not liking the irrigating scheme. But
you don&#8217;t seem to think the way he does about
it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You bet I don&#8217;t train along with him. I&#8217;m
so sick of cows that I never want to see a long
horn again. I&#8217;d like to be an engineer. I
sneaked up once or twice to the dam. It must
be fun to help built it. But I reckon it&#8217;s not for
me.&#8221; The boys were silent, each busy with
his own thoughts. Then the newcomer exclaimed,
&#8220;But here&#8217;s the place we want to do
some fishing. Grab a line and bait up!&#8221;</p>

<p>For several hours the boys fished with more<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_142"></a>[142]</span>
or less success, and during this time Bob learned
a lot about his new friend. His name was Ted
Hoyt and he had never been farther away from
home than Las Cruces. He had had some
schooling and the coming of the Reclamation
Service had fired him with an ambition to rise
higher in the world than was promised by the
education he had received. The boys grew
very chummy and it was when they were eating
their lunches that Bob finally made up his mind
to side actively with his new-found friend.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think it&#8217;s a rotten shame. I don&#8217;t think
your father ought to stand in the way of what
you want to do.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t reckon he ought myself,&#8221; was the
laconic answer. &#8220;But he does and that&#8217;s about
all there&#8217;s to it as far as I can figure.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you think it might help if I got my
boss, Mr. Whitney, to come down and talk to
him about it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Gee whiz, no!&#8221; the other cried. &#8220;I reckon
Dad would set the dogs on the Chief Engineer
from the dam. He hates him worse than
poison.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But my boss has only been here two or<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_143"></a>[143]</span>
three weeks. I don&#8217;t see how your father has
had time to quarrel with him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That makes no never mind. The man he is
laying for is the feller bossing the dam. Dad
don&#8217;t care if they change them every two days.
He can shift a grudge as fast as they can shift
men!&#8221;</p>

<p>But when they finally parted they had come
to the arrangement that Bob was to keep his
eyes open for a possible job for Ted. Ted on
his side promised that he would make one more
effort to get his father to let him do as he
wished. They planned to meet the following
Sunday at the same place and compare notes.</p>

<p>Once back at the dam Bob took his share of
the fish he had caught up to Mr. Whitney&#8217;s
cottage. &#8220;Brought you some fish, Chief,&#8221; he
said. &#8220;But I think I&#8217;ve hooked a much bigger
fish. I met a young chap down the river who
seems to be the right stuff for the Service. He&#8217;s
crazy about it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can always make use of a fellow like that,&#8221;
said the Chief when Bob had finished his story.
&#8220;Tell him for me that he can have a job whenever
he can take it.&#8221;</p>
<hr class="chap" />

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_144"></a>[144]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak"><small>CHAPTER XI</small><br />


TROUBLE</h2>
</div>

<p>But Bob didn&#8217;t have to go down the river to
tell his new friend that there was a job waiting
for him whenever he chose to come and get it.
Ted showed up at camp one night just before
quitting time. He was waiting for Bob when
the latter knocked off and had started homewards.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hello there,&#8221; said Bob. &#8220;What&#8217;re you
doing up here?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I came up after that job we were talking
about the other day.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Your father&#8217;s let you go?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not so&#8217;s you could notice it. We had an
awful fight to-day and I just up and left. I
couldn&#8217;t stand it any longer. Do you think
there is a chance of my hooking on? I&#8217;ve got
to have it because I haven&#8217;t any money to go
any further hunting one.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_145"></a>[145]</span>Then Bob told him the news that he had been
saving for next Sunday. &#8220;Come along to the
Quarter-house with me and feed, and then we&#8217;ll
go hunt Whiskers&mdash;I mean Mr. Whitney.&#8221;</p>

<p>Ted was puzzled at the reference Bob had
made to the Chief Engineer. &#8220;You called him
Whiskers&mdash;is that your nickname for him?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not the one we use on this job,&#8221; laughed
Bob. &#8220;We used that back in Virginia.&#8221; And
during supper Ted made Bob tell the adventures
he had had in Virginia with the man who was
now in entire charge of the dam.</p>

<p>Mr. Whitney was as good as his word and
gave the newcomer a chance to make good as
a rodman. Bob felt that because he had found
him he was a sort of prot&eacute;g&eacute; of his and they
were together a good part of the time. At first
Jerry was one of their group. But little by
little he slipped back into the mood of silence
and reserve which had been most noticeable
about him before the trip through the Labyrinth
had been made. Again he would go off
by himself, seeming to prefer it to the companionship
of the other two boys. Bob noticed
that very rarely did he go down stream when<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_146"></a>[146]</span>
he started off from the camp, but was headed
in the general direction of the north. Never
since that first day had he invited Bob to go
along with him and after several of the trips
he let fall remarks about the Service and his
job that did not ring true in Bob&#8217;s ears. It was
as if Jerry were nursing a grudge. But the
fact that the boy who had shared the great
adventure of the Labyrinth with him seemed to
be growing away from him again, did not bother
Bob as much as it might have had he and Ted
Hoyt not become such good friends.</p>

<p>On Sundays they went fishing together and
spent most of the time talking about the Service
and their work. Ted soon grew to have the
same passion for the Service as had Bob. He
was quick to learn and together the boys pored
over such text books as they could lay their
hands on.</p>

<p>The work on the dam had gone smoothly since
Mr. Whitney had taken the job over. Except
for minor accidents, nothing really bothersome
had happened to delay the work in any way, yet
Bob, who was now constantly with the Chief,
realized that something was bothering the man<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_147"></a>[147]</span>
he was so fond of. Gone was the half chummy,
half paternal air of Mr. Whitney. He was
irritable and not at all himself.</p>

<p>Finally it got too much for Bob and one day,
taking his courage in both hands, he blurted
forth, &#8220;Say, Whisk&mdash;Mr. Whitney, what&#8217;s
gone wrong? Is it anything money won&#8217;t
cure?&#8221; He held his breath awaiting the
answer. It was a cheeky, nervy thing to do and
if his boss did not take it the right way, he
would be perfectly justified in sending him back
to the horrible punishment of the draughting
room. But he need not have worried. Mr.
Whitney was too much of a big boy himself and
had too much understanding not to realize that
the question had been asked because anything
that troubled him meant so much to the boy.</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess I&#8217;ve been a bear lately, Bob,&#8221; he
said laughing. &#8220;But I&#8217;m up against an awfully
queer proposition and I don&#8217;t yet see just how
to tackle it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Bob was about to ask another question, but
thought better of it.</p>

<p>Evidently his keeping silence was wise, for a
minute later Whitney continued, &#8220;Although<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_148"></a>[148]</span>
everything seems all right on the surface, I&#8217;m
afraid there&#8217;s going to be trouble with the
Mexican laborers. Somebody&#8217;s been tampering
with them and the trouble down on the border
isn&#8217;t helping the situation any.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Gee, if the Greasers struck it would tie us
up for fair,&#8221; broke in Bob anxiously. &#8220;Except
for the mechanics, and that bunch of Indians
from the reservation, they are about all we&#8217;ve
got. We would have to shut down, wouldn&#8217;t
we?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t reckon it would be as bad as that,&#8221;
answered Whitney. &#8220;When Uncle Sam once
starts something, he is pretty likely to carry it
through. But we&#8217;d have a rough time of it all
right. If I could only find out who&#8217;s behind
&#8217;em&mdash;they are not capable of stirring it up
amongst themselves&mdash;I&#8217;d be able to nip the
trouble before it got started. If they do strike
and we are delayed, the Water Users Association
will start on the rampage again.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who are they and why should they be
worried by what happens here?&#8221; Bob wanted to
know.</p>


<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/illus151.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">A bullet whistled by him. Then came another and<br />
another. (Page <a href="#Page_195">195</a>.)</p>



<p>&#8220;They are the farmers who expect to benefit<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_149"></a>[149]</span>
by the water stored by the dam,&#8221; explained the
man. &#8220;They are the people who got together
and collectively pledged themselves to pay the
Government a certain amount of money each
year until all the money the Government has
spent is returned. They firmly believe that the
engineers in charge of the dam take a malicious
pleasure in delaying progress and that they try
to spend as much money as possible simply to
make the farmers pay more in the end. Naturally,
as they make such a fuss, all the engineers
know that whenever trouble comes, they will be
the first mourners.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Gee, that&#8217;s tough!&#8221; commented Bob, happy
that Mr. Whitney had enough confidence to tell
him all these things. &#8220;But about the Mexicans;
you don&#8217;t suspect anyone around the job
is the trouble maker, do you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No.&#8221; The answer was final and assured.
&#8220;But I wouldn&#8217;t put it beyond a lot of the stock
and cattlemen around here. They&#8217;ve been sore
about the dam, with as little reason as they
have on every job the Service has tackled. They
always end by being a lot better off with the
project finished than they ever would have been<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_150"></a>[150]</span>
if the range had been left alone. At first they
can&#8217;t help but suffer some annoyance from the
building of the dam. A good part of the land
which we will irrigate, while not sufficiently
productive to be good farming land, raises
enough natural grass to feed stock. Above the
dam the stored water will form a lake that will
cover thousands of acres of such pasturage, I&#8217;ll
admit. But the cattlemen are so blind that this
point is all that they can see. They will have
the same chance to profit by the irrigated lands
below. It has always worked out well in the
end.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think it&#8217;s a rotten deal they&#8217;re handing
you!&#8221; exploded the boy.</p>

<p>Big Chief Whitney laughed. &#8220;It would have
come sooner or later, so don&#8217;t worry your head
about it. I&#8217;ve got to beat this some time and it
might as well be now. I&#8217;ll find a way. But
don&#8217;t let this bother you, kid. These are my
exclusive troubles. Some day or other, if you
stay with the Service, I suppose you&#8217;ll be a Chief
Engineer and then you&#8217;ll have to worry over
things like this. No use in borrowing trouble.&#8221;
And with this he closed the talk.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_151"></a>[151]</span>Bob could hardly wait until the quitting
whistle blew. He wanted to see Ted, and
wanted to see him in a hurry. When he finally
located the other boy, he sketched out rapidly
what Mr. Whitney had said.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re with us&mdash;the Service, I mean&mdash;aren&#8217;t
you?&#8221; finished Bob seriously. &#8220;Even
if it means going against what your father
thinks is best?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You can just bet your boots I am,&#8221;
returned Ted, holding out his hand. Bob shook
it warmly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, then, I want you to help. The Chief
needs to know who&#8217;s back of the trouble and I
believe you can find out!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Me?&#8221; the other boy echoed. &#8220;How?
Shoot!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;This is the plan. You go back home and
say you are sick of engineering&mdash;that riding
range is good enough for you. If you do that
your father will be likely to take you back, won&#8217;t
he?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mebbe so. I dunno, but go on.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The Chief thinks the cattlemen are behind
the trouble. I guess if you get home and can<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_152"></a>[152]</span>
mingle with &#8217;em, you ought to find out what&#8217;s
up. Don&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I get you. I can try it anyhow. But, Bob,
I figger there&#8217;s a lot in that trouble down at the
border. Before I left home some broncho
busters happened in from Columbus and they
said somethin&#8217; was liable to bust most any time.
The Greasers are sore as pups since we sent a
bunch of troops down there. If some yellow
half-breed could blow up what we&#8217;ve got
finished of the dam, wouldn&#8217;t it be a mighty fine
feather to stick in his sombrero?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;P&#8217;r&#8217;aps that&#8217;s got something to do with it,
but I&#8217;ve a hunch Mr. Whitney&#8217;s right about
those cattlemen. It&#8217;s up to you to find out.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll hike up home to-morrow and see if the
old man will let me stick around. He was
pretty much het up when I left. But, wait a
minute. Are we going to let Jerry in on this
play?&#8221;</p>

<p>Bob hesitated for a perceptible interval before
he answered. &#8220;I don&#8217;t know. Somehow I
don&#8217;t think we&#8217;d better,&#8221; he said at last.
&#8220;Lately I don&#8217;t know what has come over
him. He never was very enthusiastic about<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_153"></a>[153]</span>
the Service but I thought he was really fond of
Mr. Whitney. But he&#8217;s let out some funny
remarks and it might be possible that someone
has hurt his feelings. I&#8217;ve a sneaking notion
that we ought not to tell him. I don&#8217;t know why,
but I just feel it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve got a hunch?&#8221; cried Ted. &#8220;Out
West here we always play hunches. Go to it;
you&#8217;re probably right. By the way, don&#8217;t he
go up the river a lot?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He starts that way,&#8221; answered Bob. &#8220;And
I remember a long time ago he asked me to go
up to some ranch with him. It just so happened
that I didn&#8217;t want to go. It was the day I met
you, Ted.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you think&mdash;&#8221; began the other boy.</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess we haven&#8217;t got a right to think until
we know for sure, because if Jerry is in cahoots
with the cattlemen, we&#8217;ll be on to it before long.
Oh, thunder, Ted, I just <i>don&#8217;t</i> believe Jerry is
mixed up in anything wrong.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then you&#8217;ll let him in on this?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know. I&#8217;ve got to think about it
some more. P&#8217;r&#8217;aps I can get him to explain.
I&#8217;ll try to.&#8221;</p>

AT THE CABLE TOWER</h2>

<p>Jerry did not come home that night and consequently
Bob was not forced to decide whether
or not his room-mate was to be trusted. The
next morning Mr. Whitney mentioned that he
had sent Mr. Rutherford and his corps up the
river to check up some topographical figures.
They were to be gone several days.</p>

<p>This would delay for a time the necessity of
taking action in regard to Jerry, and Bob was
grateful for the leeway it gave him. Anything
and everything might happen in the spare time
he was given. Perhaps all the trouble would
blow over. He certainly hoped so.</p>

<p>Ted Hoyt evidently had wasted no time in
carrying out Bob&#8217;s plan, for he did not show up
at breakfast. His chances of success worried
Bob all morning and once or twice Mr. Whitney
had to call him down for some inattention to the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_155"></a>[155]</span>
business at hand. But when the day passed and
Ted had not returned, Bob was reasonably certain
that the cattleman had not refused to take
in his son. That was a help.</p>

<p>Since becoming an aide to the Chief, Bob had
not entirely given up his unofficial inspection
trips. The dam and all the operations that
were the building of it still fascinated him and
his spare time was given to roaming over the
job. So good an observer was he, that time
after time he surprised Mr. Whitney with his
knowledge of some obscure detail of the work.</p>

<p>&#8220;How the dickens do you happen to know
<i>that</i>?&#8221; he would exclaim.</p>

<p>&#8220;Happened to be over there the other night
and used my eyes,&#8221; was the usual reply of the
boy.</p>

<p>There was a full moon the night following
the day Ted had gone home and Bob had taken
advantage of it to go up to the west cableway
tower, from the foot of which he could see the
whole work lying bathed in the intense silver
light. He wanted to think and he was always
able to do that better out of doors.</p>

<p>He did not feel he was doing his share<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_156"></a>[156]</span>
towards clearing up the trouble which threatened
to break. Cudgel his brains as he would,
there seemed nothing for him to do. It had
been his idea to send Ted off, but since then
he might just as well have been in Alaska for
all the good he&#8217;d been. For a long time he lay
there, without finding a way out of his
difficulty.</p>

<p>At last he was about to get up and go home
when he saw a figure dodging from shadow to
shadow and making up the hill in the general
direction of his position.</p>

<p>Glancing about him, Bob saw no way to get
away from the tower without being seen by
the furtive newcomer. The moon was high and
the ground at the tower&#8217;s foot was clear of any
cover. Something told him he wanted to know
what the approaching figure was up to and he
would spoil any chance of that if he disclosed
his whereabouts. Happening to glance up he
saw that one side of the tower was in shadow.
He crawled around to it. Then he had an idea.</p>

<p>&#8220;Crazy lummox, why didn&#8217;t I think of this
before,&#8221; he muttered to himself as he began to
climb up the tower. It was built of steel and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_157"></a>[157]</span>
an iron ladder had been provided to make the
oiling of the pulley wheel at the top a simple
task.</p>

<p>Hardly had he reached a height he felt was
safe, when the figure glided swiftly across the
clearing and sat down almost in the spot he had
just quitted.</p>

<p>Bob was surprised when he saw the man roll
a cigarette and coolly light it. This display of
unconcern as to whether or not he was observed,
did not fit in with the dodging tactics he had
employed when coming up the hill. Then the
explanation came in a flash. Surely the spot
had been chosen on account of the clear space
around it and the impossibility of anyone&#8217;s coming
upon it unobserved. The man had dodged
on his way up because he did not want to be
recognized by a prowling night watchman. Once
he had arrived, no one could get near enough
to be dangerous.</p>

<p>In the flare of the match Bob had recognized
the newcomer. It was a Mexican, Miguel
Philipe, who was an underforeman at the trap
rock quarry.</p>

<p>But before Bob&#8217;s mind had accepted the fact<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_158"></a>[158]</span>
that a Greaser was sitting up here in the moonlight,
instead of gambling or watching a cock
fight down in the Townsite, a crackling in the
underbrush to the right caught his attention.
A moment later a figure stepped out into the
clearing. To his dismay, he recognized the
approaching man.</p>

<p>Jerry King!</p>

<p>Jerry King, who was supposed to be up country
on a map-making expedition, was back and
meeting a Mexican in a place that must have
been agreed upon before.</p>

<p>All the suspicions of Jerry&#8217;s attitude that he
had fought down, came back in a rush and were
not lessened when he saw by the signs of greeting
displayed by Miguel, that Jerry was the
person he expected to see.</p>

<p>Bob&#8217;s perch on the tower was far from comfortable,
so he hoped the conference going on
below him would last no great length of time.
The thin iron rungs of the ladder cut into his
legs and his arms had begun to ache from the
strain of holding himself in place without making
any noise that would give him away. To
add to his discomfort, he soon realized that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_159"></a>[159]</span>
although he could overhear clearly every word
that passed between the figures on the ground
it would do him no good, as they were talking
in Spanish, a language in which Bob remembered
Jerry could at least make himself understood.
Since his arrival at the dam, the Eastern
boy had made some attempt to pick up a working
knowledge of it, but his time had been so short
that he had not got very far. Therefore, only
a word here and there meant anything to him
and as these were simple words, they gave no
clue to what was being discussed.</p>

<p>About all he could gather was from their
actions. Jerry seemed to be instructing the
Mexican and emphasizing that certain things
must be done. Miguel at times grew excited
and waved his hands frantically as a torrent of
words came from his lips. Finally, just as Bob
was sure his cramped muscles would force him
to move his position, thereby giving away his
presence, they seemed to come to an agreement.</p>

<p>A moment later Jerry had slipped out of the
open space into the underbrush directly behind
the side of the tower to which Bob was clinging.
For a long moment Bob held his breath, fearing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_160"></a>[160]</span>
that Jerry might turn and see his dark form
making an unaccustomed blot against the iron
work. But as the cracklings of the bushes died
away, he realized that Jerry&#8217;s one desire was to
get as far away as possible in the shortest space
of time.</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;ll have to hike some,&#8221; thought Bob, &#8220;if
he&#8217;s going to get back to Rutherford to-night.&#8221;
Then he turned his attention to the Greaser, who
had not moved out of the sprawling position he
was in. The ache in Bob&#8217;s muscles became
almost unbearable. When the Mexican rolled
and lit another cigarette as if he expected to stay
where he was all night, he was almost tempted
to drop off the ladder and let the worst happen.</p>

<p>But this would not do except as a last resort,
when all his will power and determination had
fled. With infinite care Bob shifted his position
a little and so gave his tortured muscles a
slight rest. A few moments later he was glad
he had not given up to his fatigue, for Miguel
arose leisurely and sauntered down the hill,
evidently not at all bothered about being seen.</p>

<p>When he thought it was safe, Bob dropped
off the ladder and for a moment or so sat quietly,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_161"></a>[161]</span>
fully occupied in nursing his cramped limbs
back to some degree of usefulness. Then, having
given the Mexican plenty of time to reach
the bottom of the hill, Bob followed, his mind
busy with the new angle of the situation chance
had laid before him.</p>

<p>One thing was sure. After what he had seen
he could no longer pretend even to himself that
Jerry was not mixed up somehow in what certainly
seemed to be a disgraceful business. He
could put no other explanation on it. Although
it was hard to think that the boy who had
shared the adventure of the Labyrinth with
him could be guilty of anything really wrong,
he realized the time had come when he could
not let anything but facts sway him. Jerry was
on the other side without a doubt. Most probably
he was the connecting link between the
cattlemen who wished to stir up trouble for the
dam by means of the Mexicans, and the leaders
of the Mexicans themselves.</p>

<p>But it puzzled him to know why Jerry could
be a traitor to Mr. Whitney and the Service.
What was the inducement the cattlemen had
offered him, and what had happened on the job<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_162"></a>[162]</span>
that had made him unhappy enough to be
unfaithful to it? There was no answer to these
questions. He gave it up as a bad job.</p>

<p>The next thing to decide was whether the
time had come to tell Mr. Whitney what he had
learned. This was easy. He did not have a
complete case yet and would not until Ted came
back with some sort of report.</p>

<p>The best thing for him to do was to learn as
much as possible regarding Miguel and to find
out if he had been at all active in stirring up
discontent among his countrymen. Acting on
this resolve, he made guarded inquiries the next
day of some of the men on the job who came in
contact with the gang of which Miguel was a
sort of deputy foreman.</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s a bad egg,&#8221; was the comment of Tim
Flannigan, the engineer of the dinky that pulled
the rock cars from the quarry to the crusher.
&#8220;He&#8217;s all the time startin&#8217; somethin&#8217; down to
the Townsite. He&#8217;s got a game cock that nobody
kin lick, and the marshal has had him up several
times for gambling. Tried to run him out
of camp a bit back but such a gang of Greasers
threatened to leave with him that Boss Adams,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_163"></a>[163]</span>
who was here before Boss Whitney came, told
the marshal to keep a close eye on him and let
it go at that.&#8221;</p>

<p>This information was valuable to Bob, especially
the part about the other Mexicans leaving
if Miguel went. From this it was clear to see
that the man had influence among his countrymen
and probably was just the person to start
trouble, if trouble was coming.</p>

<p>That night, in accordance with his plan to try
to get as much as he could of the general atmosphere
of the situation, Bob decided to go down
to the lower camp. On the highest ground were
the mechanics&#8217; houses, and from them, sloping to
the river bank, were the bunk houses and
shacks of the Mexican laborers. At one side, a
little apart, was the camp of the Indians who,
aside from the Mexicans, were practically the
only laborers to be had in that section of the
country. Of course, they were far less in number
than the Mexicans. The street on which the
motion picture theatre and the stores were
located, was well lighted by the power plant
and had been dubbed &#8220;Broadway.&#8221;</p>

<p>Bob mingled with the crowd and finally<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_164"></a>[164]</span>
drifted into the moving picture show. His mind
was busy with his problem and he did not pay
as much attention as usual to the scenes that
were flashed before him on the screen. He
became aware, however, even in the dim light,
that directly in front of him sat an Indian,
seemingly alone. A little to the left were a
crowd of Mexicans, who, from their boisterous
behavior, seemed to have been able to smuggle
some whiskey into the camp, which, of course,
was absolutely forbidden on a Government job.</p>

<p>By some chance the next picture was a lurid
western romance in which Indians and cowboys
were all jumbled together with furious riding
and rescues of the beautiful heroine. Of course,
the Indians in the picture were the villains. As
the film unfolded the Mexicans grew more excited
over the story and Bob noticed that they
began to throw slighting remarks towards the
Indian sitting directly in front of him.</p>

<p>Finally something was said which was more
than the redman could stand. He got up and
in a dignified manner moved to the spot where
his tormentors were sitting. He spoke to them
in Spanish.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_165"></a>[165]</span>A moment later the place was in an uproar.
Fired by bad whiskey and the knowledge that
numbers were with them, the bunch of Mexicans
had jumped for the solitary figure.</p>

<p>Bob was on his feet in an instant and sprang
for a Mexican who had slipped into the aisle
and was coming upon the Indian from behind.
In the dim light everything was confused, but
Bob&#8217;s fist found its mark and the man fell. The
Indian was holding his own valiantly but Bob&#8217;s
help had come at the right moment. Together
they backed towards the door, fighting as they
went. Then the lights went up and the Mexicans,
fearing the consequences of their action,
slipped into the nearest seats, hoping to escape
notice.</p>

<p>When the fight ended in this fashion, the
Indian drew himself up to his full height and
with a scornful look on his face turned and
walked out of the theatre. Bob followed and on
the street found the man he had helped waiting
for him.</p>

<p>As he came up the Indian held out his hand
and said gravely, &#8220;Feather-in-the-Wind thanks
you.&#8221; Without further word he marched off.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_166"></a>[166]</span>As he made his way back to the upper camp,
Bob realized that in all probability he had done
a foolish thing to mix in on a quarrel between
the Mexicans and the Indians. That probably
would mark him out among the Mexicans as
someone unfriendly to them and it might have
been better if he had stayed in the background.
But the sight of the crowd jumping on the
solitary Indian had been too much for him.</p>

<p>When he reached his room he found the
light on and Jerry about to slip into his bunk.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hello, Bob,&#8221; was his greeting. &#8220;Just got
back from up river. Rutherford had me measuring
the elevation of all the anthills from here
to Canada.&#8221;</p>

<p>Bob answered him rather curtly, amazed that
Jerry could seem so carefree when he must be
concealing some terrible secret. It was surprising
that Jerry should be in such a good
humor. He was much more communicative
than he had been for weeks.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s your grouch?&#8221; Jerry asked, seemingly
puzzled by Bob&#8217;s manner. &#8220;Aren&#8217;t you
going to welcome me home any better than
that?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_167"></a>[167]</span>&#8220;Oh, I&#8217;m tired,&#8221; returned Bob, &#8220;that&#8217;s all.
I got into a sort of jam in the lower camp
to-night.&#8221; He decided it would be better not
to let Jerry know that he was at all suspicious,
so in order to appear natural, when the other
boy wanted to know the details, he told him of
his share in the brawl at the theatre.</p>

<p>&#8220;Must have been fun,&#8221; was Jerry&#8217;s comment.
&#8220;And if you&#8217;ve made a friend of Feather-in-the-Wind,
you ought to be proud. He&#8217;ll be
useful, too, as he&#8217;s the chief of that bunch of
Apaches. Once an Indian is a friend, you know,
he&#8217;s a friend for good.&#8221;</p>

<p>As Bob tried to go to sleep his amazement
that Jerry could be so two-faced, grew more
and more pronounced. Jerry did not exhibit
any of the symptoms of a person who was engaged
in a treacherous plot, rather he seemed
happy and buoyant over the accomplishment of
something well worth while. Could he have
been mistaken?</p>

AN UNEXPECTED ALLY</h2>
</div>

<p>The following night, just as Bob was about
to turn in, Ted Hoyt knocked at his door.
Evidently Ted had come in a hurry, for he was
covered with dust and was breathing hard.</p>

<p>&#8220;You were right, Bob,&#8221; he panted. &#8220;The
cattle bunch are behind any trouble that might
get unhitched. But come along with me and
we&#8217;ll talk as I start back. I&#8217;ll lose my pull with
the old man if he catches on that I&#8217;ve been
away from the house. I had to slip out the
window to get up here as it is. The sooner I
get back the less chance that he&#8217;ll get wise!&#8221;</p>

<p>Once they were out of the house they started
in the direction of the Hoyt ranch. &#8220;Now, tell
me about it,&#8221; urged Bob.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; Ted replied, &#8220;I hung around the
house all day yesterday and worked like a dog.
Dad was tickled to death when I got back.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_169"></a>[169]</span>
Thought that I&#8217;d proved by coming back that
he was right. But he took good care to give
me a bunch of stiff jobs all the same. I didn&#8217;t
get onto anything yesterday until about ten
o&#8217;clock. I had hit the hay but had not gone
to sleep, when Dave Wesley and John Harper
rode in. Both of &#8217;em are cattlemen and they
were some lit up, believe me. They had been
down to Las Cruces and had mopped up all
the liquor in sight. They had been around the
ranch a lot recently but I had not paid much
attention to them. When they came along
before they had long confabs with Dad, but
took care to have them where they could not
be overheard. Last night they were not so
careful and in spite of all my old man could
do they talked and talked loud. The booze
made &#8217;em careless, I reckon, &#8217;cause I heard them
all right.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What did they say?&#8221; asked Bob, quickly.</p>

<p>&#8220;A whole heap. It seems that the talk was
in town that the lid was going to blow off down
at the border and that if they could get the
Greasers riled up on the dam, the trouble would
not be laid to them but simply on the general<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_170"></a>[170]</span>
bad blood between the Mexicans and Americans.
Wesley and Harper were so enthusiastic
they wanted to blow up the spillway and the
mixing plant. Even in their enthusiasm they
realized that the portion of the dam already
built would be more than a job for dynamite.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But what did your father say to all this?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank heaven, he wouldn&#8217;t stand for the
rough stuff. He told them that just out of
sheer meanness he would not mind delaying
things, but when it came to blowing up Government
stuff and laying it onto the Mexicans,
it looked too much like treachery for him. He
was American&mdash;that the plan did not seem
like the American way of doing things. Gee, I
was proud of him. Finally the other two men
started to raise thunder with the old man and
he kicked them out. That&#8217;s all. I reckon I
found out what you wanted, didn&#8217;t I?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You bet you did,&#8221; was Bob&#8217;s answer.
&#8220;Good for you. I don&#8217;t think there is any
question but what the cattlemen are behind
this.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid you&#8217;re right,&#8221; was the other&#8217;s
answer. &#8220;But I&#8217;m sure glad my old man isn&#8217;t<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_171"></a>[171]</span>
mixed up in it any more than he is. I s&#8217;pose you
want me to go back and stick around home?
Don&#8217;t want to much&mdash;things are more&#8217;n likely
going to happen round here and I&#8217;d like to be
on the job.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Bob, &#8220;I do. I don&#8217;t think you&#8217;ll
have to stay there long because if anything happens
it&#8217;ll happen quick. After that I don&#8217;t think
even your dad will be against your doing what
you want.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But what about Jerry?&#8221; asked Ted. &#8220;Has
he come back?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s been back twice,&#8221; said Bob, &#8220;and I
don&#8217;t know what to make of it.&#8221;</p>

<p>He told Ted of the happening at the foot
of the cable tower.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t let him fool you,&#8221; said Ted when he
had listened to the end of the story. &#8220;Jerry&#8217;s
mixed up in this as sure as shooting, and he&#8217;s
putting on that careless attitude just as a
blind.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid you&#8217;re right, Ted,&#8221; said Bob.
&#8220;But I sure hate to think it.&#8221;</p>

<p>They had covered quite a lot of ground while
talking and now Ted spoke.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_172"></a>[172]</span>&#8220;Don&#8217;t come any further. Beat it back. I
reckon we&#8217;ve told each other everything we
know. Good night. I&#8217;ll come back again as
soon as I hear anything new.&#8221;</p>

<p>Bob started to retrace his steps but he had
not gone far before he was aware that soft
footsteps were following him. He turned in his
tracks and stood still. A moment later the
Indian he had befriended the night before
slipped up beside him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Feather-in-the-Wind is watching Boss Bob,&#8221;
he said quietly. &#8220;Greasers in show last night
make big talk. Swear much. They hurt you
because you help me. When you go out I
follow. Now I go home with you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Bob was overcome with astonishment. Not
for a minute had he thought that the episode
of last night would have brought on him more
than the passing enmity of the Mexicans, but
he realized that the Apache probably knew what
he was about. Then it came to him that if
there was bad blood between the Indians and
Mexicans, in all probability Feather-in-the-Wind
would know if there was any trouble
brewing amongst the Mexicans themselves.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_173"></a>[173]</span>&#8220;It was good of you,&#8221; he said as gravely as
the Indian had spoken. &#8220;But you can help me
further perhaps.&#8221;</p>

<p>Feather-in-the-Wind signified his willingness
to do what he could by a nod of his head.</p>

<p>&#8220;Your people and the Mexicans&mdash;they do
not get along together?&#8221;</p>

<p>Again a nod.</p>

<p>&#8220;You like Big Boss Whitney?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Big Boss good to my people. Not let storekeeper
cheat or Greaser hurt,&#8221; was the answer.</p>

<p>&#8220;You want to help the Big Boss?&#8221;</p>

<p>Once more a gesture of assent.</p>

<p>&#8220;Listen. Big Boss thinks the Mexicans will
start trouble. Does not know what man is
responsible&mdash;what man is saying big words
and starting trouble. You can help if you find
out and tell me who the man is.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, can do,&#8221; stated the Indian, and as they
had approached the upper camp during their
talk, he made a swift move of the hand in farewell
and slipped swiftly into the shadows.</p>

<p>&#8220;Gee, but he went quick,&#8221; said Bob to himself,
&#8220;and I wanted to put him wise to Miguel!
Well, he&#8217;s gone, so there&#8217;s no use bothering.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_174"></a>[174]</span>
Now to tell Mr. Whitney the dope Ted
brought!&#8221;</p>

<p>But when he came to it, the front of the
Chief&#8217;s cottage was dark. A ray of light came
from the kitchen and Bob went to the back.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where&#8217;s the Boss?&#8221; he demanded of the
Chinaman who served Mr. Whitney. &#8220;Gone to
bed?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nope. Boss man he gone downside El
Paso. Get little yellow tlicket, gone off slam
blang!&#8221;</p>

<p>From which Bob gathered that a telegram had
called the boss from the job and that it was
his job to sit up alone with his troubles until
the Chief chose to come back.</p>

THE UNMASKING OF JERRY</h2>
</div>

<p>As far as the dam was concerned and the
work going on there, things were quiet for
the next day or two. But the situation between
the United States and Mexico seemed to be
growing more and more tense. From the border
came rumors of dissatisfaction caused by the
presence of American troops on patrol duty and
the deportation of Mexicans from the United
States back into their country. As these reports
multiplied they furnished a topic of discussion
for all. The American element feared especially
the effects any serious clash might have on the
work at the dam and openly discussed the possibility
that an attack of some sort might be
made on the work itself.</p>

<p>Bob learned that the cattlemen were strongly
in favor of having the United States go into
Mexico and stay there until things had been<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_176"></a>[176]</span>
settled for keeps. The most outspoken of the
crowd wanted the United States to conquer
and then to annex Mexico, feeling that it was
the only way in which peace could be assured
for any length of time. The reason for their
feeling was that the ranchers along the border
were in constant fear of cattle rustlers, who,
once they were in Mexico with their booty, were
safe from pursuit. Under Diaz, who had ruled
Mexico firmly, there had been no great trouble.
In those days raids were few and they were
quite as likely to have been made by American
outlaws as by Mexicans. Besides, Diaz would,
wherever it was possible, aid in the return of
the stolen property. Since he had lost control
things had changed. The constant revolutions
that came after him left the border states without
law and order. All sorts of robbery and
murder were permitted to go unpunished.</p>

<p>Even the builders of the dam often felt that
intervention was the only way out of a bad
situation. Bob was sure that this unsettled condition
was responsible for Mr. Whitney&#8217;s being
away from the work at a time when matters
were in such a ticklish condition.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_177"></a>[177]</span>Nothing new had developed in the plot which
he felt was being formed between the cattlemen
and the Mexicans by means of Jerry. Feather-in-the-Wind
had not reported anything further.
What worried Bob most was his suspicions
regarding Jerry King. Although he was sure
that Jerry was not doing what he should,
he realized that all he had to go on was circumstantial
evidence. He had no real proof!</p>

<p>But he could not trust Jerry, and the feeling
worried him. When Sunday came around without
the return of Mr. Whitney he determined to
make a last effort to find out just where Jerry
stood. He did not dare risk coming out into
the open and asking Jerry what his suspicious
movements meant. If Jerry were guilty of
wrong-doing, he would at once know that Bob
was onto something. In that case it was quite
possible that Jerry would fire the first gun before
Bob was ready to combat it.</p>

<p>There was only one other thing which seemed
practicable. Of course it had in it a great
element of chance as to his finding out anything
of value. But he determined to try it for want
of anything better.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_178"></a>[178]</span>On Sunday morning he was up before his
room-mate, and when the latter came out the
front door of the Quarter-house he was waiting
for him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Going up river again to-day, Jerry?&#8221; asked
Bob.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thought I would,&#8221; answered Jerry shortly,
but halting.</p>

<p>&#8220;Think I&#8217;ll go along then,&#8221; stated Bob as
casually as possible. &#8220;I&#8217;ve never been up that
way and I&#8217;d like to see the country that the lake
will cover.&#8221;</p>

<p>Jerry was taken aback and for a moment
he hesitated before answering.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why&mdash;why you never wanted to go before
and I&mdash;I don&#8217;t think I can take you with me
to-day.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t care where you&#8217;re going,&#8221; said Bob
laughing. &#8220;We&#8217;ll go exploring, like we did at
the Labyrinth.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But&mdash;but,&#8221; stammered Jerry, &#8220;I&#8217;m going
to see somebody. They expect me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, let them wait,&#8221; said Bob. &#8220;You can
go next Sunday. We haven&#8217;t been out together
for a long time. Come on, be a sport.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_179"></a>[179]</span>There was nothing to it. Evidently Jerry saw
that Bob was determined to go and he was
afraid that if he refused it would look funny.
Bob saw the hesitancy and continued:</p>

<p>&#8220;Besides, I&#8217;d like to see a ranch. I&#8217;ve never
been to one since we came out here. The people
you&#8217;re going to see won&#8217;t mind my coming along,
will they?&#8221;</p>

<p>Again Jerry hesitated and Bob realized that
a struggle was going on within him.</p>

<p>At last Jerry said with forced enthusiasm,
&#8220;All right, old man, come along. I reckon
there&#8217;s another nag for you down at the stables.
We&#8217;ll go up to old man Holman&#8217;s ranch. He
asked me to come up for dinner. There&#8217;s
always an extra place for anyone who stops
by.&#8221;</p>

<p>Bob was rather elated that his plan had
worked so far and they started off mounted on
a couple of bronchos that the stable in the lower
camp provided.</p>

<p>As they rode along Bob ignored Jerry&#8217;s evident
irritation, knowing that it was caused by
his forced presence. He talked about a thousand
things. Jerry tried to answer in a light<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_180"></a>[180]</span>
and casual manner but he made a rather bad
attempt at it.</p>

<p>The sun was hot as they rode and they
kept close to the winding river where there was
some vegetation and a few trees that gave
a little shelter. After they had covered several
miles they came upon crude attempts at irrigation
which extended the fertility of the land
back some distance from the river.</p>

<p>&#8220;These canals were started by the Indians,&#8221;
said Jerry, &#8220;and were made bigger and longer
by the white settlers. When we get up to Holman&#8217;s
you&#8217;ll see some real irrigation.&#8221;</p>

<p>They did. Bob realized they were approaching
the ranch by the sight of broad green fields
which were watered by orderly ditches and
laterals spreading out from the main canals
like the branches of a tree. Here and there
were gates which could be used to direct the
water down any given canal or ditch.</p>

<p>&#8220;I thought Holman was a cattleman,&#8221; said
Bob. &#8220;This looks as if he were a farmer.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He is a cattleman, though,&#8221; was the answer.
&#8220;The range is to the north. A branch river
flows into the Rio Grande and forms a triangle<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_181"></a>[181]</span>
of green grazing. Holman has put in this irrigation
merely to grow crops necessary for house
use. It&#8217;s taken him years to make this place,
and the dam we&#8217;re building will wipe it out
overnight.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s tough luck,&#8221; said Bob, thinking that
if he sympathized Jerry might let something
fall which would be useful. But his ruse did
not work, for Jerry merely said:</p>

<p>&#8220;It is pretty hard, but when the dam is built
there&#8217;ll be many other fields below the dam.
He&#8217;ll have to move down there, that&#8217;s all.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was very little more chance for conversation,
as they were rapidly approaching a
low, adobe house surrounded by outbuildings
which were evidently stables and laborers&#8217;
houses. When they galloped in they were hailed
by a bunch of cowboys who were perched on the
corral fence. Jerry answered them with a shout
and waved his hand but continued to lead the
way to the main building. On the porch two
men were sitting in chairs tilted up against the
wall. Jerry introduced Bob to them.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is my friend, Bob Hazard, Mr. Holman,&#8221;
he said. &#8220;Wanted to come and see a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_182"></a>[182]</span>
ranch. He is a rodman down at the dam.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Glad to make your acquaintance,&#8221; said the
man Jerry had addressed.</p>

<p>He was rather stout. Humorous eyes
twinkled from under bushy brows. &#8220;Glad to
show ye what we got, though we ain&#8217;t goin&#8217; to
have it long if you fellows keep on buildin&#8217; that
there dam. Meet up with my foreman,&#8221; he said
turning to the other man.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hello, Link,&#8221; said Jerry. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t bring
Bob up only to show him the ranch, but to let
you give him a square meal for once. If you&#8217;ve
still got Sing Lee properly trained he&#8217;ll get it!&#8221;</p>

<p>The man Jerry had addressed as Link got up
and gravely extended his hand to Bob.</p>

<p>&#8220;I figure you won&#8217;t go away hungry,&#8221; he said
in a voice Bob was surprised to find was cultivated
and soft. &#8220;The old man here sees to it
that we get enough. It won&#8217;t be long either.
I&#8217;ll go and see. I&#8217;m sort of housekeeper as well
as foreman around this hang-out. Fine job
for a full-grown man.&#8221;</p>

<p>With that he disappeared into the house.</p>

<p>&#8220;Must be a big help to have Link around,
isn&#8217;t it, Mr. Holman?&#8221; said Jerry.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_183"></a>[183]</span>&#8220;You said something, my boy. The only
trouble is I can&#8217;t <i>keep</i> him around. He&#8217;s been
with me a dozen times but he always goes away
again. Sometimes he ups and leaves overnight
and then I&#8217;m out a foreman. But he knows he
can always come back. When he is here he
makes things hum. Besides, he&#8217;s the only man
who can make the Chink cook a good meal.&#8221;
Then he turned to Bob. &#8220;Soon&#8217;s we&#8217;ve had
something to eat I&#8217;ll have one of the boys show
you around the place. You must be hungry
after your ride, &#8217;specially if you&#8217;re not used
to riding.&#8221;</p>

<p>Bob laughed, &#8220;We get enough to do week
days on the dam to get up a pretty good appetite.
But I won&#8217;t deny that I&#8217;ll be ready when
the dinner bell rings. We&#8217;ve got a Mexican
cook where we grub and he&#8217;s a lot better on
quantity than quality.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right,&#8221; said the rancher; &#8220;Greasers
are all like that. If they start to rustle off some
of our cattle they go in and take a big bunch.
Don&#8217;t seem to make much difference what sort
they lift. They just take the nearest to hand.&#8221;
He grew serious. &#8220;I want to tell you boys<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_184"></a>[184]</span>
it&#8217;s getting bad. I had more cattle stole the
last two year than ever before. I wish the
United States would make up its mind to go
into Mexico and clean out that bunch of thieves.
It&#8217;s the only way we&#8217;ll ever get any peace here
on the border.&#8221;</p>

<p>Bob was interested in this view of the matter.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you think that will help, sir?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;I sure do. It&#8217;s disgraceful that we ain&#8217;t
gone in there a&#8217;ready. The Greasers are killing
our people and doing everything they can to
raise trouble. Why I&#8217;d do almost anything
myself to get things started down there. I own
a bunch of land there that I was planning to use
when that dam you&#8217;re a-buildin&#8217; runs me out o&#8217;
here, but, shucks, it ain&#8217;t worth a jitney to me
now, an&#8217; won&#8217;t be onless Uncle Sam gets a move
on pretty quick.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think you&#8217;re right,&#8221; put in Jerry. &#8220;There
ought to be nothing but the United States
between Canada and the Panama Canal. But
I don&#8217;t think we&#8217;ll go into Mexico unless the
Mexicans raid our territory and kill somebody.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If they did that,&#8221; exploded the rancher,
&#8220;there&#8217;d be nothing to it. We would be obliged<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_185"></a>[185]</span>
to go in. I could come mighty nigh wishing
somebody a hurt if &#8217;twould bring it about.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then before the conversation went further
the foreman came out the door. Bob noticed
for the first time how powerful was the man&#8217;s
build. He was tall and rangy, yet he seemed
to radiate power.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come on in, folks,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Sing Lee&#8217;s
done himself proud.&#8221;</p>

<p>During the meal the conversation was without
any special interest, but afterwards, when Mr.
Holman had retired for his siesta, Link O&#8217;Day
joined the boys on the porch. The talk drifted
from cattle to farming and from farming to
forestry. On this topic the man spoke not
only with knowledge but with enthusiasm.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s great stuff,&#8221; he stated. &#8220;Formerly the
lumberman would go into a forest and cut his
lumber without any regard for the future. What
he did not use he would ruin. It was not until
most of the harm was done that the Government
woke up to the fact that in a few
years more there would be no more timber
worthy of the name.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Now it&#8217;s against the law to cut trees under<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_186"></a>[186]</span>
a certain diameter, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221; put in Jerry King.
Bob saw the great interest that Jerry showed
in the subject and all during the conversation
he felt that a close attachment was being formed
between Link O&#8217;Day and the boy. Probably
one of the chief attractions the ranch had held
for Jerry before he had become mixed up in the
Mexican tangle was the relationship with this
man. While Bob was thinking these things
O&#8217;Day had answered Jerry&#8217;s question in the
affirmative and had proceeded:</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, but there is a lot more to forestry than
that. I&#8217;d like to show you some day how modern
logging is done.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sort of <i>gets</i> me,&#8221; was Jerry&#8217;s enthusiastic
comment. &#8220;Somehow the thought of shady
woods sounds mighty attractive after the dose
of sun and desert I&#8217;ve had the last couple of
years. How about you, Bob?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Interesting all right, but I wouldn&#8217;t swap
the Service for it by a long shot!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re a Service bug,&#8221; smiled Jerry, who
had lost all signs of being uneasy. &#8220;I bet you&#8217;ll
be an engineer all your life.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope so,&#8221; Bob answered. &#8220;Won&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_187"></a>[187]</span>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think so. There are a lot of other
things I&#8217;d rather do if I had the chance. Forestry&#8217;s
one of &#8217;em,&#8221; he finished with a smile at
the ranch foreman.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you still feel that way in the fall, I
might take you along with me when I drift
out. I&#8217;ll be going up north then, I think.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Will you? That would be great!&#8221;</p>

<p>The man nodded and for a moment Bob was
amazed at the look of resemblance that was
common to both. They might have been
brothers or father and son.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll talk more about it later,&#8221; was what
he said. &#8220;Now, young Hazard, if you want
to see the ranch I&#8217;ll go along with you. Coming,
Jerry?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, Link, I guess not. I&#8217;ve seen it all and
I think I&#8217;ll go down and visit with the boys at
the bunkhouse till you get back.&#8221;</p>

<p>Bob thought he detected a glance of understanding
flash from one to the other but put it
down to his being suspicious of everything that
occurred. He accepted O&#8217;Day&#8217;s invitation and
they moved off the veranda in separate directions.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_188"></a>[188]</span>Bob instinctively liked the man who was
showing him what had been done to reclaim the
desert. By the time they got back to the house
they had become good friends and the man had
asked the boy to come up and visit the ranch
again.</p>

<p>They found Jerry at the bunkhouse sitting
in a game of poker with four or five of the cowboys.
The players asked Bob to take a hand
in the game but he refused. He had never
played cards for money and he never intended
to. Somehow, he was surprised that Jerry was
playing; he had never mentioned cards, but Bob
had always felt that Jerry was not that sort.
He watched for a moment and saw that Jerry
was evidently quite far behind. He was flushed
and nervous.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come on, Jerry,&#8221; Bob said; &#8220;let&#8217;s be getting
back.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; snapped the other. &#8220;I&#8217;m not ready.
Go along yourself if you&#8217;re in such a hurry.&#8221;
Then he went on with the game.</p>

<p>But before Bob left he heard a name which
he recognized. Someone had spoken to one of
the players calling him &#8220;Harper.&#8221; He tried<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_189"></a>[189]</span>
to think where he had heard the name before.
Then it came to him. Harper was one of the
men Ted Hoyt had told him about who had
tried to make Ted&#8217;s father join in the plot
against the dam. Although Bob had started for
the door he stopped. Possibly the other man
Wesley was here too. He was, for a moment
later Jerry said:</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll call you, Wesley,&#8221; and shoved some chips
to the center of the table. The man addressed,
a rather villainous looking person, smiled and
laid down his hand. Jerry did not smile. He
threw his cards face down on the table. He had
lost.</p>

<p>Bob&#8217;s mind began to act quickly. The links
of his chain of evidence against Jerry were
rapidly coming together. From Ted he had
learned that Wesley and Harper represented
the most desperate faction of the cattlemen;
they were the spokesmen of the crowd that
wanted the Mexicans to do real damage to the
dam. Here they were gambling with Jerry and
winning from him.</p>

<p>Wasn&#8217;t there a likelihood that they were doing
this to get the boy under some obligation to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_190"></a>[190]</span>
them? If so, it was a point against Jerry. Then,
Jerry was intimate with Miguel, who undoubtedly
was the leader of the dissatisfied and reckless
element among the Mexican laborers. The
cattlemen had no way of getting in touch with
the Mexicans at the dam without being suspected
of some treachery. Hence Jerry&#8217;s coming
to them might possibly have been a lucky thing
from their standpoint. Still all this was circumstantial
and as yet Bob had no proof. But
everything that happened made him more and
more suspicious of Jerry&#8217;s good faith.</p>

<p>At last he slipped out of the bunkhouse, went
up and said good-bye to his host and rode off
in the direction of home. In all probability
Jerry would not come home until late.</p>

<p>Bob made his way back toward the dam
slowly, his mind too busy with the situation in
which he found himself to pay much attention
to the beauties of the landscape. Before he
had gone many miles he was surprised to hear
the sounds of galloping hoofs coming behind
him. His first thought was that Jerry had
changed his mind and was going to accompany
him back to camp. But the noise was more than<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_191"></a>[191]</span>
one horse could make, so he was prepared to
see strangers ride past him. He turned in his
saddle as the first horse came around the bend
in the trail.</p>

<p>It was Jerry, closely followed by the men he
had identified as Wesley and Harper! In a
moment they caught up to him and stopped.
But Jerry&#8217;s first words were more surprising
than his sudden appearance.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;d you sneak off for like that?&#8221; he
said sneeringly. &#8220;Going back to tell the boss
you caught me gambling?&#8221;</p>

<p>Jerry&#8217;s two companions had reined up also
and were waiting for the answer. Bob quickly
saw the object of this maneuver. After he
had gone one of them had suspected that his
being at the ranch with Jerry was not just an
innocent visit. Probably they had struck on
what was really the truth of the matter&mdash;that
Bob was suspicious in a general way of Jerry
and had taken a chance that he might learn
something definite if he came out and spent
a day with him. Evidently Jerry had not been
able to make Wesley and Harper believe that
Bob&#8217;s suspicions had been quieted and they had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_192"></a>[192]</span>
insisted on following him on the pretext of
shutting him up about the poker business. This
was to be used only as a cloak under which to
threaten him against telling anyone of <i>any</i>
suspicions he might have. They hoped in this
way to frighten him into silence.</p>

<p>But Bob would not be frightened. He realized
that the time had come when there could
be no more fighting under cover. Throwing his
head up and looking Jerry in the eyes he said
quietly,</p>

<p>&#8220;You know that I won&#8217;t tell Whitney about
your poker playing. What I am going to tell
him is that you&#8217;re a traitor to the Service.&#8221;</p>

<p>Jerry quailed before the thrust. &#8220;What&mdash;what
do you mean?&#8221; he stammered.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, what do you mean?&#8221; said one of the
men threateningly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I mean that you and the cattlemen are planning
to interfere and delay the work of the
Service! For the cattlemen it is only a crime.
But for you to help them, is treachery!&#8221;</p>

<p>As he spoke Bob did not flinch before the
threatening attitude of the two cowboys. &#8220;You
little shrimp,&#8221; said Wesley. &#8220;I&#8217;ve got half a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_193"></a>[193]</span>
mind to wring your neck and throw you in the
bushes.&#8221;</p>

<p>Bob paid no attention to him. &#8220;Jerry,&#8221; he
said, &#8220;is it true? If you tell me now it isn&#8217;t
I&#8217;ll believe that you just got mixed up in the
poker game and&mdash;and&mdash;Oh, Jerry, I can&#8217;t
believe it. Please&mdash;please tell me it isn&#8217;t true.&#8221;</p>

<p>For a moment Bob thought he had won, for
there was a look in his former chum&#8217;s eyes as
if he was struggling to express something he
could not say aloud. But Jerry&#8217;s words belied
the message of his eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why&mdash;why of course not. Why of&mdash;of
course it isn&#8217;t true. I&mdash;I don&#8217;t know what you
mean. I&mdash;I&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>From this hesitating manner Bob knew that
Jerry was guilty.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are lying,&#8221; he said evenly. &#8220;Traitor!&#8221;</p>

THE CAPTURE OF BOB</h2>
</div>

<p>&#8220;Traitor!&#8221; repeated Bob and then pulled his
horse&#8217;s head around and struck hard with his
quirt. In a flash his little horse was flying
in the direction of home. It was a desperate
chance he was taking, for he had read in the
faces of the two men as he turned that they
were determined that he should not get back
to the dam with his suspicions confirmed. He
knew that in running he braved possible death,
for he had noticed that both men were armed.
The sound of his horse&#8217;s hoofs and the rushing
wind drowned the noise that would have told
him whether he was being pursued or not. He
was bending low in the saddle and it was hard
to turn and see what had become of Jerry and
his companions. But he managed it.</p>

<p>They were coming all right. But for the
time he was holding his own and even doing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_195"></a>[195]</span>
a little better. They had raced their horses
from the ranch in their endeavor to catch up
with him, while he had only ambled along over
the same distance. He exulted as he realized the
distance was rapidly growing greater between
them.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why don&#8217;t they shoot?&#8221; he thought.
Hardly had the thought flashed through his
brain when a bullet whistled by him. Then came
another and another.</p>

<p>&#8220;Guess I&#8217;m too far,&#8221; he thought. &#8220;Out of
range!&#8221; But he guessed wrong, for a moment
later his pony stumbled and fell. He rolled
clear and staggered to his feet and started to
run on. But a moment later he was jerked
to earth. One of the men had roped him.</p>

<p>When his captors came up he realized that
Jerry was not with them and he turned to look
back over the way they had come. No Jerry
was in sight. Evidently as soon as real trouble
started the men had decided it was better for
Jerry to keep out of it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thought you&#8217;d get away, did you?&#8221; said
Wesley with an ugly laugh. &#8220;Swell chance.&#8221;</p>

<p>Bob kept quiet. They tied his arms to his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_196"></a>[196]</span>
sides with the lasso and then one of the men
went over to the pony Bob had ridden and, putting
a revolver to its head, fired. Bob realized
that no matter how mean a citizen a cowboy
might be, he would not let an animal suffer.
The shot which had dismounted him had hit
the pony in one of the hind legs and had
broken it.</p>

<p>Little was said as they took Bob and hoisted
him into the saddle of one of their horses.
Harper got up behind him and handled the reins
on either side of his body. He turned the
horse&#8217;s head away from the trail into the low
brush that here covered the ground. The other
man followed.</p>

<p>Bob was not gagged. Probably his captors
were certain that no matter how hard he yelled
there would be no one near enough to hear.
That being the case, the boy decided that it
was useless to wear out his lungs. So he kept
his tongue still and suffered in silence.</p>

<p>After the little procession had been going for
some time, Harper began to taunt Bob.</p>

<p>&#8220;You figgered you was goin&#8217; to git clean
away an&#8217; dust it for the dam, huh? Goin&#8217; to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_197"></a>[197]</span>
tell &#8217;em that we-uns up here was aimin&#8217; to play
thunder with that ol&#8217; bunch o&#8217; masonry that&#8217;s
a-goin&#8217; to take the bread out o&#8217; our mouths,
huh?&#8221;</p>

<p>Bob paid no attention to this outburst, letting
it go past his ears. Wesley&#8217;s voice from
behind took up the refrain.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>And</i>, if it&#8217;ll do you any good, which it ain&#8217;t,
you might know that we are not only <i>aimin&#8217;</i> to
bust up that dam down yonder, but we&#8217;re <i>goin&#8217;</i>
to do it, sure. It&#8217;ll all be over by the time you
get back there, though, so I reckon the information
won&#8217;t help you much.&#8221;</p>

<p>They both laughed.</p>

<p>&#8220;This li&#8217;l&#8217; rooster thinkin&#8217; he could come
along up this here way an&#8217; fool us! But Jerry&#8217;s
got the hand all dealt with Miguel. The
Greasers will turn the trick any night now.
Then it&#8217;s good-bye ol&#8217; dam for some time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yep,&#8221; boasted Harper, &#8220;an&#8217; mebbeso we
can keep a-puttin&#8217; it off ontwell they git plum
tired of tryin&#8217; to buck us cowmen.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You can&#8217;t do it!&#8221; flared out Bob, unable to
restrain himself any longer. &#8220;The Service will
beat you, and don&#8217;t you forget it!&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_198"></a>[198]</span>&#8220;Shut up!&#8221; roared Harper in his ear. &#8220;Children
should be seen and not heard!&#8221; And to
emphasize his remark he fetched the boy a
ringing clip on the side of the head. Not having
the use of his hands, Bob lost his balance
and fell out of the saddle.</p>

<p>A short dash for freedom was all he got, for
Wesley on the other horse caught him before
he had gone many steps. This time they tied
his feet by means of a rope under the horse&#8217;s
belly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Reckon you won&#8217;t try <i>that</i> again,&#8221; grunted
Harper when once again they were proceeding
towards what the boy imagined would be some
sort of prison.</p>

<p>His captors began talking about the situation
at the Mexican border and Bob drank in every
word they said. It was just now that he began
to realize what depth of feeling there was about
the way the situation was being handled and
to what lengths the ranchers and cattlemen
would go to force the United States to make
war on the other country. Wesley and Harper
undoubtedly were &#8220;bad men,&#8221; but Bob was
convinced by their talk that they had started<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_199"></a>[199]</span>
on this particular piece of villainy for reasons
which they thought were right. Probably when
the thing began, they never planned anything
worse than a strike among the Mexicans in
order to delay for a year or two longer the
flooding of the rangeland. Then had come the
chance to induce the Mexicans to commit worse
crimes in order to strengthen the feeling against
Mexico and thus bring on war. Holman, the boss
of these men and Bob&#8217;s host, had said that he
wanted to move his stock to his ranch in
Mexico when the dam was finished&mdash;but it
would be foolish to do that while the country
was still so unsettled. Presumably, there were
a lot of men in the same fix as Holman, and
these, naturally, wanted the United States to
step in and make the unsettled country peaceful.</p>

<p>As he was revolving these things in his mind
they came to an opening in the thick brush. It
lay right on the edge of the river, close to
which they had been traveling. Evidently it
was the place that had been decided upon
as his prison, for, almost screened by the
encroaching scrub oaks, was an adobe hut.
Bob could not imagine what it had been used<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_200"></a>[200]</span>
for. As they approached it in the gathering
gloom of night, it did not seem to have any
opening except a door. No windows were
visible from the direction in which they came
and Bob doubted if there were any on the other
side.</p>

<p>&#8220;I figger our bird will be pretty near safe
in this li&#8217;l&#8217; cage,&#8221; said Dave Harper. &#8220;&#8217;Member
when we holed up that hoss thief here?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure do,&#8221; was the answer. &#8220;&#8217;Specially
safe as I elect myself a c&#8217;mittee o&#8217; one to stick
here on guard.&#8221;</p>

<p>They unbound the boy and pulled him off
the horse. They went rapidly through his
pockets and relieved him of everything they
could find&mdash;his watch, small change, and the
jackknife he always carried. Then, before he
had a moment to limber up his cramped muscles,
he was dumped unceremoniously into the hut
and the door was pulled to.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s good we fixed up this door and put this
bolt on,&#8221; Bob heard Wesley remark as the bar
fell into place. &#8220;Now both of us can go back
to the ranch so&#8217;s it won&#8217;t look suspicious. The
kid is safe here till doomsday.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_201"></a>[201]</span>&#8220;Mebbeso, but I ain&#8217;t goin&#8217; to take no chance
on it! I&#8217;m goin&#8217; to stay right here till morning
and then you can come down and do a spell o&#8217;
watchin&#8217; too!&#8221;</p>

<p>Probably this last remark was meant only
to impress him, Bob thought. If the hut would
hold him, Harper wouldn&#8217;t spend the night
watching. It would be too uncomfortable.
Moreover, it would be all the same if Harper
was able to make his prisoner believe he would
be outside waiting for an attempt at escape.
Once more he heard a voice. This time it was
directed at him. It was Harper.</p>

<p>&#8220;Listen, kid! Someone will let you out o&#8217;
there before you starve. And I&#8217;ll be camped
right here until the thing that&#8217;s goin&#8217; to happen,
happens. You might jest as well make yourself
at home and stop worrying, &#8217;cause it won&#8217;t get
you nowheres. Good night and sweet dreams!&#8221;</p>

<p>The murmur of voices came to him for a
little and then all was still.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak"><small>CHAPTER XVI</small><br />


THE ESCAPE</h2>
</div>

<p>Naturally, Bob&#8217;s first thought was of escape,
of some way in which to get out of the four walls
which kept him from carrying the warning to
Mr. Whitney that might mean the saving of the
dam. If he could only get out, he did not fear
Harper&#8217;s being on guard. The last speech that
had come to him through the door had been so
contradictory and had emphasized so strongly
the fact that Harper <i>would</i> be outside, that Bob
was quite sure he wouldn&#8217;t. At any rate he was
willing to take the chance if only he could get
out.</p>

<p>The first thing was to examine his prison.
There might be an opening that had been overlooked.
Bob started from the door and felt
every inch of the wall within his reach. His
fingers had to do duty for his eyes, as by this
time night had fallen and the interior of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_203"></a>[203]</span>
hut was pitch dark. Not even a ray of moonlight
came through the cracks in the door. In
this slow fashion he made the circuit of the
room without finding even a crack in the dried
clay.</p>

<p>He was trapped!</p>

<p>But Bob refused to give up hope. Too much
depended on his getting free and being at the
dam in time to prevent anything serious happening.
Back at the door, he threw his whole
weight time and time again on the boards but
they held firm. This way, too, was closed to
him.</p>

<p>What next? Feverishly he started to go
through his pockets, hoping that in their hurried
search the cowmen had overlooked his jackknife.
If they had he could try to dig through the
walls! Hope flared up for a moment but soon
died, as all he could find was a loose button
and a broken match that had lodged in the lining
of his khaki jacket.</p>

<p>&#8220;Much good they&#8217;ll do me,&#8221; he muttered to
himself and sat down with his back to the door
to plan some new attempt.</p>

<p>But at first all he could think of was what<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_204"></a>[204]</span>
would happen if he did not get out. Probably
it meant the blowing up of the dam and
machinery and a serious uprising of the Mexicans&mdash;one
that would mean bloodshed. It was
terrible to think of, yet he was convinced that
that was the least that could be expected. The
cattlemen could not hold the Mexicans in check
once they had been started on the rampage.</p>

<p>Mr. Whitney knew that something was wrong,
but he did not know what. Bob&#8217;s confidence in
his Chief was great but he feared that no matter
how strong and capable Mr. Whitney might be,
he would be powerless to avert the calamity that
seemed on the way, unless he had some definite
notice that it was approaching.</p>

<p>Who else could help?</p>

<p>Feather-in-the-Wind! Perhaps the Indian
would miss him and sound the alarm? Besides,
Bob had asked him to look out for trouble
with the Mexicans and perhaps, just perhaps,
he might tell Mr. Whitney.</p>

<p>Then, as suddenly as the hope had come, it
fled. Possibly Mr. Whitney had not come back!
Feather-in-the-Wind alone would be no use!
He <i>must</i> get out himself!</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_205"></a>[205]</span>As he pondered his problem, his fingers had
been playing with the loose button that had been
in his pocket, and now it slipped from his hand
and rolled off on the dirt floor toward the center
of the room. Rather aimlessly, he reached out
and groped for it. As his hand swept the floor
it came in contact with a fine, floury substance.
&#8220;Ashes,&#8221; was his thought. An inch or so
farther and he gripped an object that he felt
to be a half burned stick of wood.</p>

<p>Immediately the button was forgotten, for an
idea had come to him. He would burn down
the door!</p>

<p>He had a match and if there was enough wood
there was a chance. The planking of the door
was dry and there was no reason why it would
not catch.</p>

<p>The possibility of getting free intoxicated him
and on hands and knees he searched the floor.
There were other sticks. Evidently the horse
thief had been given a fire and it had only been
put out when he was taken away for the last
time&mdash;probably to the nearest tree high enough
to swing a man clear of the ground. Besides
this, to Bob&#8217;s great delight, a little pile of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_206"></a>[206]</span>
unburnt wood was stacked in one corner. He
wondered why he had not stumbled over them
when he first made the circuit of the hut.</p>

<p>Only when he had carried all his treasure to
the door, did he realize that in all probability
his work had been in vain.</p>

<p>There was nothing to use as kindling! He
had only one match and a broken one at that.
To make sure of his fire catching he ought to
have paper or some substance equally easy to
light. The wood was dry but it was too big to
catch from one match.</p>

<p>Bob almost sobbed with his great disappointment.
It seemed to be the end; there was nothing
more to be done. He had explored the
room&mdash;every nook and cranny of it&mdash;and he
had come across nothing that could be used.</p>

<p>But he made one more try. Possibly a picture
or newspaper had been tacked on the wall
and had escaped his fingers when he had first
gone round the room.</p>

<p>There was no better luck this time and when
he came again to the door he was ready to
admit defeat.</p>

<p>Then, in a flash, he knew he wasn&#8217;t beaten!<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_207"></a>[207]</span>
Far from it. As he yanked off his coat he muttered
savagely to himself.</p>

<p>&#8220;You poor nut! You haven&#8217;t any sense anyway!&#8221;</p>

<p>After his coat, Bob ripped off his flannel shirt
and tore it down a seam. Then, with the greatest
care, he began to unravel the threads that made
up the fabric. The loose threads would burn
when the cloth itself would only go out. Before
he had a pile of threads that he felt would be
sufficient for his purpose, his fingers ached and
his nails were bleeding.</p>

<p>At last, however, he decided to take the chance
of having enough. Going over the stack of
sticks, he selected the smallest and those that
had already been somewhat burned, as they
would be the easiest to catch fire again. Then
he separated his flannel ravelings into three
piles and put them against the door.</p>

<p>Now came the crucial moment. He felt in the
pocket where he thought he had put the single
match that might possibly be the key to his
prison, and for a second was sick with fear that
he had lost it. But his fingers closed on the
precious object and he breathed again.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_208"></a>[208]</span>Holding it as if it were glass, Bob scratched
it on the hard floor. It did not light. Again
he pulled it across the hard surface and a little
flare spurted from the head and then died
out.</p>

<p>Bob gasped. He was sure that the match&#8217;s
usefulness was over, but feverishly, throwing
caution to the winds, he rasped the head against
the planking of the door.</p>

<p>It lit, flashing a glare into his eyes so accustomed
to the utter darkness. But his gesture
had been so violent that the stick broke and
the flaming head flew off and fell on the floor.</p>

<p>Bob grabbed it and, before it could go out,
nursed the flicker in his cupped hands, not
realizing that it was burning his fingers cruelly.
Carefully, yet swiftly, he carried the flame to
the little pile of threads. As these caught, his
heart grew light with thankfulness.</p>

<p>Little by little the boy fed the smoldering ravelings
of his shirt with the other piles, holding
in the center of the glowing coal the smallest
of the sticks.</p>

<p>Hardly daring to breathe, he watched and
hoped for a flame to spring from the wood.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_209"></a>[209]</span>
If it came, he had won; if not, his losing was
the end of the fight. There would be no other
way out.</p>

<p>Just as Bob was about to give up hope, for
his fingers told him that the last pile of threads
was about all gone, a sliver of flame ran up
the stick he held in his left hand. It went out
but a second later another one came and
stayed!</p>

<p>With the utmost caution, the boy laid the
burning stick down on the faintly red ashes of
the threads and arranged other sticks on it.
Then, gently, he breathed over it and the little
flame grew and multiplied. Soon it was going
briskly, but it was not till then that the load of
fear dropped from Bob&#8217;s shoulders.</p>

<p>When the fire was burning strongly, he moved
it as close to the door as possible so that the
flames could lick the planking. His whole
scheme depended on the door burning sufficiently
to let him either crawl through or to weaken it
to the point where his strength could break it
down. Therefore, once the fire was in place
he must not be stingy with his wood; the hotter
the blaze, the more chance he had.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_210"></a>[210]</span>He piled on all the sticks he had and watched
the flames mount higher and higher until the
whole doorway was a sheet of roaring fire.</p>

<p>He thought the door had caught but he could
not be sure. But soon he lost interest, for a
new danger threatened him. It was one which
he had failed to foresee when he had planned
this means of escape.</p>

<p>There was no outlet for the smoke! The
little room was practically air-tight except for
the cracks around the door and these now
were bringing in only the oxygen that allowed
the fire to burn.</p>

<p>Choked, stifling with the intense heat, Bob
fell on his face, remembering that smoke always
rises.</p>

<p>For a moment or two this helped, for he was
able to breathe, but soon the smoke was everywhere
and Bob knew that he would have to
move.</p>

<p>Was he to die, trapped like a rat? Was this
the end of his adventure? It looked very much
like it. But something would not let him give
up. He would make one more attempt for his
life and liberty.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_211"></a>[211]</span>Struggling to his feet, his eyes almost blinded,
smarting with the sting of the smoke, he dashed
headlong into the flaming door.</p>

<p>He bounced back, not knowing that his clothes
were afire in several places. Instinctively he
charged again.</p>

<p>This time a crash, a splintering of the wood
was the result. Once more he dived into it
and the next moment he was in the gray air
of the early dawn.</p>

<p>Stumbling, panting, he ran around the corner
of the hut, urged by the knowledge that he was
afire. Luckily the river nearly touched the
back wall of the hut that had been his prison.
A few steps and he fell face downward in the
shallows.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak"><small>CHAPTER XVII</small><br />


DYNAMITE!</h2>
</div>

<p>In the cool water, Bob soon forgot his hurts.
Coming out on the shore he took stock of the
damage that had been done. His hands were
sore and stinging sensations from different parts
of his body told him that he had not come off
scot-free. Such clothes as he had on were
ruined and he knew that in all probability he
was such a sight that his own father would
not have recognized him if they had met face
to face.</p>

<p>Assured that he had suffered no damage that
was really serious, Bob gave some thought to
other pressing matters. Since no one had
appeared after he had broken out of the hut,
he must have been right when he figured that
Harper had had no intention of sticking around
all night.</p>

<p>But because no one was around now, it did<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_213"></a>[213]</span>
not mean that no one would be. Probably the
best plan would be to go and go quickly before
either Wesley or Harper decided to come down
and bring their captive food and water.</p>

<p>&#8220;Some surprise those chaps will get!&#8221;
laughed Bob to himself as he started down the
river in the general direction of the dam. &#8220;I
wonder what they&#8217;ll do. Hit the high spots
probably getting away from this neck of the
woods!&#8221;</p>

<p>It took longer to get back to camp than he
had supposed, for he was afraid to leave the
river which served as his guide. Therefore it
was nearly noon when a bend of the river
showed him the dam.</p>

<p>Fearing that his appearance would cause a
sensation, Bob waded and then swam across
the shallow river and struck off to one side,
meaning to circle around to the upper camp.
Then he could slip into the Quarter-house by
the back way.</p>

<p>This maneuver was executed without mishap
and the only person who saw him go in was the
Mexican cook, who paid little attention.</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess he thinks the Gringo got mixed up<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_214"></a>[214]</span>
with a charge of dynamite!&#8221; was the boy&#8217;s
reflection as he scuttled up to his room.</p>

<p>It was not long before he presented himself,
washed and changed, at the general offices. As
he went in he asked the girl at the telephone
if Mr. Whitney had returned.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not yet,&#8221; was the crisp reply, &#8220;but Mr.
Taylor wants to see you. Jerry King didn&#8217;t
show up to-day either and he&#8217;s worried.&#8221;</p>

<p>So Jerry had not come back. It did not surprise
Bob much, but it meant that Jerry had
now openly allied himself with the other faction.
The fight was to be in the open, from
now on. Coming back to himself, he asked:
&#8220;Where&#8217;s Mr. Taylor then?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In his office.&#8221;</p>

<p>He found Mr. Taylor busy over some blue
prints. The engineer looked up as he entered
and Bob at once saw that the man was angry.
His first question proved it.</p>

<p>&#8220;What the dickens do you mean by not
reporting this morning? Just because Mr.
Whitney is away, do you think you can take
a vacation when you feel like it? And King,
too; wait till I get hold of him! But what have<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_215"></a>[215]</span>
you got to say for yourself, young man?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I couldn&#8217;t help it&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Couldn&#8217;t help it!&#8221; exploded the irate man.
The total responsibility for the project had
fallen on him for the past few days and it had
made him nervous. &#8220;Of course you could help
it. You&#8217;ve got to help it if you belong to the
Service!&#8221;</p>

<p>Bob waited until the storm had passed and
then asked calmly:</p>

<p>&#8220;Has the Chief told you he suspects trouble
with the Mexicans?&#8221;</p>

<p>The man looked at the boy sharply but made
no reply. From his manner Bob was sure that
Mr. Taylor knew but did not wish to confess
his knowledge. Figuring that his silence was
equal to an assent, Bob went on:</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Whitney told me something about it
and the reason I&#8217;m late to-day is that I got
mixed up in the mess&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>This startled Mr. Taylor.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&mdash;you&#8217;ve found out something?&#8221; he
stammered eagerly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; answered Bob, &#8220;I have. I wanted
to tell Mr. Whitney personally about it but as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_216"></a>[216]</span>
things are likely to happen right off, I think
we&#8217;d better get busy without him.&#8221;</p>

<p>Rapidly Bob sketched out what he had learned
during the past few days and related briefly the
adventure that had befallen him the day before.
As to Jerry&#8217;s part in the mix-up, he said as
little as possible, but of course it could not be
entirely hushed up. As Bob was talking, Mr.
Taylor took the telephone receiver off the hook
and called a number.</p>

<p>By the time his story was finished, a knock
sounded on the door and it opened to let in
Jenkins, the camp marshal.</p>

<p>&#8220;I just telephoned the marshal to come up
as we were talking,&#8221; explained Mr. Taylor. &#8220;I
want him to get those two cowboys if he can.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Won&#8217;t be much chance,&#8221; put in Bob, &#8220;if
they&#8217;ve been to the hut. But if they were going
to leave me there without food or water, perhaps
you can get &#8217;em.&#8221;</p>

<p>The engineer stated the case briefly so that
the officer would understand.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll try to git &#8217;em,&#8221; announced Jenkins. &#8220;I
guess I better git the sheriff down to Las Cruces
to call out a posse&mdash;&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_217"></a>[217]</span>&#8220;No, don&#8217;t do that,&#8221; put in Taylor. &#8220;This
is a Federal job and we don&#8217;t want the county
in on it. Go to it alone.&#8221;</p>

<p>Stolidly the man took his orders and stumped
out. When he was gone Mr. Whitney&#8217;s assistant
turned to Bob.</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you think will be the first move?
Did you hear anything definite?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, sir, and I haven&#8217;t any idea what they&#8217;ll
do. Anything is likely to happen!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then the only thing to do is to put on
extra watchmen and keep a sharp lookout for
trouble among the Mexicans. I&#8217;ll see to it at
once.&#8221; He started up as if to go out. Then,
remembering Bob, he said, &#8220;You&#8217;ve done good
work, Hazard. Sorry I was so grumpy when
you came in. Take the remainder of the day
off and rest up.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you, sir,&#8221; the boy answered, &#8220;but
I couldn&#8217;t sleep now. There&#8217;s too much excitement
around!&#8221;</p>

<p>With this they left the office, Taylor to see
that all preparations were made to forestall any
attack, and Bob to take up the work Mr. Whitney
had left for him to do.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_218"></a>[218]</span>The day and night passed quietly, but the
next morning the mess room of the Quarter-house
was in a turmoil. News had come in
that a gang of Mexican bandits had made a
raid on Columbus, killing and wounding many
Americans. This report was unconfirmed but
rumors flew thick and fast. Some had it
that it was the army of Carranza and others
that it was merely an unorganized deed of a
rash bandit. Most of the men thought it was
Villa.</p>

<p>When Bob heard the news he immediately
connected Mr. Whitney&#8217;s prolonged absence
with it. The Chief was not back and in all
probability he had remained to talk over the
best manner of protecting Government property
from any mishap. The raid was so daring
that it showed the possibility that others might
follow and the dam was near enough the border
to be in actual danger. Bob realized that in
all probability this was just what the cattlemen
wanted; that it might mean intervention.
Especially so if more outrages took place at
once.</p>

<p>All during the day he worked with a cloud of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_219"></a>[219]</span>
apprehension hanging over him. But nothing
stirred. The Mexicans at the noon hour broke
up into groups and talked excitedly, but as far
as Bob could see they did their work without
any friction with their bosses, and under Mr.
Taylor&#8217;s generalship the whole job moved
smoothly.</p>

<p>But there was something wrong in the air.
The very calm itself seemed unhealthy, and
Bob was glad when nighttime came. He noticed
that Mr. Taylor had again put on the extra force
of watchmen, as he had planned, all of whom
were Americans. This had been done quietly
and passed without comment from the Mexicans.</p>

<p>However, just before the quitting whistle
blew, Bob happened to be near the spot where
the Indians were excavating. He took this
opportunity to go up to Feather-in-the-Wind
who was directing his men. Ostensibly he asked
something regarding the work but it was only
to give the Indian a chance to convey any message
he might have. The Apache did have something
to say.</p>

<p>&#8220;Meet Feather-in-the-Wind by rock crusher<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_220"></a>[220]</span>
to-night,&#8221; he whispered swiftly, but cautiously.</p>

<p>It was sufficient. Bob walked off unconcernedly
but as soon as dark had fallen he went
to the appointed place. He had not been there
long when the Indian glided up to him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you learned anything?&#8221; asked Bob
quickly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; Greasers much excited. One man make
bad medicine. He Miguel. They plan big
strike&mdash;no more work. To-day came news
much killing on border. Miguel tell &#8217;em Gringo
all scared. They keep quiet, then capture dam.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Are they going to do what he says?&#8221; put
in Bob in a tense whisper.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, Miguel very much strong. Greasers
grumble but do what he say.&#8221;</p>

<p>But when Bob started to thank Feather-in-the-Wind
for finding out what he had, the
Apache stopped him. &#8220;Wait! More!&#8221; he said.
&#8220;One my young men got keen eyes. Not
dimmed by white man&#8217;s whiskey. He see Miguel
go away from camp one, two, t&#8217;ree nights. He
take something with him. Young man no follow.
No worry him much. Perhaps go to-night.
You want us follow?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_221"></a>[221]</span>&#8220;You&#8217;re whistling,&#8221; said Bob shortly.</p>

<p>Probably Feather-in-the-Wind did not understand
the slang but he got what Bob meant,
for he said, &#8220;Come!&#8221; and started off in the
direction of the lower camp. He did not go
through the village but cut up on the hillside,
walking swiftly as if he knew where he was
bound. Bob followed.</p>

<p>A few minutes later a slim shadow rose out
of the chaparral. Feather-in-the-Wind spoke
in his own language to this newcomer. Evidently
this was the brave who had kept note
of Miguel&#8217;s comings and goings. The conference
over, Bob&#8217;s friend uttered the one word,
&#8220;Wait!&#8221; and sat down. The other Indian
slipped away. Bob followed the example of
Feather-in-the-Wind.</p>

<p>From where they were sitting, screened by the
undergrowth, they could see a section of a rough
path that led up the hillside. For a long time
nothing happened. As the Indian did not speak,
Bob felt it best to remain quiet also. Probably
there was a reason for it. The delay did not
worry him much, however, as there was plenty
of material for his mind to be busy with. Ever<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_222"></a>[222]</span>
since he had talked with Mr. Whitney, events
had tumbled upon him one after another. Mr.
Whitney had gone and Ted was doing outpost
duty. Jerry was on the other side. Only the
Indian was left to him and he was not much of
a counselor. True, he was beginning to prove
himself a great help but through the limitations
of language he could not be used to discuss
what ought to be done regarding the things they
found out. What the outcome of the mess was
to be was beyond Bob&#8217;s imagination to foresee.
He was determined to do what he felt was his
duty, and if the consequences were serious it
could not be helped.</p>

<p>His reverie was broken by a nudge on the
arm. He looked up to see a shadow darting
along the path. Nearer and nearer it came until
it passed almost close enough to the point where
they were sitting to be touched by Bob&#8217;s hand
should he thrust it from cover.</p>

<p>The young Indian had been right. It was
Miguel. Even in the uncertain light Bob could
see that he carried a queer-shaped package
under his arm.</p>

<p>A moment or so later the Indian got up and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_223"></a>[223]</span>
motioned to Bob that it would be safe to follow.
They did not take the path but threaded their
way amongst the underbrush, the sand deadening
their footsteps. So cleverly did the Indian
pick his way that hardly a sound was made by
their coming in contact with the bushes. Bob
had difficulty in keeping up with his guide, yet
he did his best and when they reached the crest
of the hill he was but a few steps behind.</p>

<p>Once here, the Indian stopped and took an
observation. An almost imperceptible grunt
escaped him and, turning on his heel, he
motioned Bob to follow. It was a surprising
move, for the Indian practically retraced the
steps they had just taken. Bob was soon to
know the reason, however, for halfway down
the hill the Indian spoke, not turning his head.</p>

<p>&#8220;Fool Greaser! Go all way up hill only to
throw people off track. I know where he make
for. Come!&#8221;</p>

<p>Bob was breathing hard when they finally
reached the spot where the Indian decided to
stop. It was above the dam proper and on the
same side of the river. Again they established
a hiding place in the underbrush but this time<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_224"></a>[224]</span>
it was near the edge of the clearing. Below
them was a widening of the river where the
coffer dam had been built. This was erected
to divert the water of the river into the spillway,
which left the river bed dry for the construction
of the main dam.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why do you think he will come here?&#8221;
asked Bob, amazed at the Indian&#8217;s tactics. He
didn&#8217;t for a moment doubt that Feather-in-the-Wind
knew what he was about, yet it surprised
him and he wanted an explanation.</p>

<p>&#8220;Easy,&#8221; said the Indian. &#8220;Only two places
go when get top of hill. One way lead to station,
other way to upper camp. He start direction
upper camp. I know he no go there. Therefore
he go round and come back to dam. Nearest
place him come back.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was easy once it was explained, Bob realized,
and the words brought a complete faith
in his guide&#8217;s methods.</p>

<p>Again silence was necessary, for if Miguel
was coming it would not be long before his
arrival. Come he did and only a few yards
from them. Bob held his breath until Miguel
passed them and reached the river level. There<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_225"></a>[225]</span>
he put down his package, which Bob noticed
he handled with the utmost care. But this did
not impress the boy as much as did the next
move of the man under observation. Going up
to a rock which showed itself above the ground,
he knelt and began scooping away the sand from
one side of it. After a few moments of this
work he evidently found what he had been
digging for, because he picked some objects
out of the hole he had made and laid them at
his side.</p>

<p>Involuntarily Bob gasped. He recognized
what it was that Miguel had taken from the
hole and what probably was also in the odd-shaped
package he had been carrying.</p>

<p>It was dynamite, dynamite stolen probably
from the work and brought up and stored here
for some evil purpose. Evidently Miguel was
preparing to strike the first blow in the plot
against the dam.</p>

<p>Bob kept still, feeling that he would soon
know what Miguel planned to do with the
explosive, for if whatever plan the Mexican
had conceived was not to be consummated
to-night, it was evident that he would have<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_226"></a>[226]</span>
buried the additional stuff he had brought
instead of digging up his cache.</p>

<p>In this he was not mistaken. Miguel produced
from around his body a coil of fuse and
began joining the sticks of dynamite and placing
detonating caps in them. Every muscle in the
boy&#8217;s body ached to jump from the hiding place
and grapple with the man who was arranging
such wholesale destruction, but evidently the
Indian realized what was going on within
him, for he felt a restraining touch on his arm.
At once he knew what it meant. The Indian
was telling him that it would be foolish to
attack the Mexican when he had so much
sudden death in his hands. Before they could
reach him, no matter how swiftly they acted,
the Mexican could throw the dynamite and the
damage would be done. There was nothing to
do but wait and hope that Miguel would give
them an opening when there was more possibility
of averting the catastrophe.</p>

<p>The Mexican worked swiftly and at last he
had his infernal machine ready. Straightening
up, he carried it to the coffer dam and began
laying the dynamite sticks at equal intervals<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_227"></a>[227]</span>
along the bank. This dam was constructed
of timber backed up by refuse material from
the crusher and the excavation. It was neither
high nor wide at this time as it only served
to divert the ordinary flow of the Rio Grande.
It had not been destined to cope with any flood,
should one come, as the engineering plan was to
get the dam in such shape as to withstand a
freshet before the rainy season came on. But
the dynamite the Mexican was laying was sufficient
to wreck what had been built, and, should
the water be released, it would undo thousands
of dollars worth of work at the main dam,
besides the delay caused by the rebuilding.</p>

<p>It <i>was</i> the first blow in the Mexican campaign
and at all hazards it must be stopped. Bob
knew this and the Indian at his side knew it.
Miguel went farther and farther from them
towards the center of the river. They could
follow him with their eyes as his movements
were clearly outlined in the white moonlight.
There was no watchman on the coffer dam.
There seemed no reason for one; yet Bob
realized that a watchman was needed everywhere
with this plot seething.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_228"></a>[228]</span>It was a horrible situation, for there seemed
to be nothing that could be done. Probably
the Mexican was desperate enough to sacrifice
his life if he should be detected while laying
his mine. He would set off the dynamite if he
saw anything to disturb him. Therefore, to
attack him openly seemed out of the question.</p>

<p>What was to be done? There seemed no
answer. At last an idea came to Bob. &#8220;Go
quick,&#8221; he said to the Indian, &#8220;get help! Bring
a gun. Perhaps we can shoot him! I&#8217;ll stay
here and watch. You can go quicker than I.
Hurry!&#8221;</p>

<p>Feather-in-the-Wind knew it to be the only
plan and started off with long running leaps,
keeping himself well hidden from the Mexican.
There was just a chance that he could
get to the camp and back before Miguel could
complete his dastardly work.</p>

<p>As soon as the Indian was gone Bob started
to carry out a plan of his own. He knew the
Indian would not have allowed him to take the
chance, so he had been forced to use a stratagem
to get Feather-in-the-Wind out of the way.</p>

<p>Kicking off his shoes, he wormed his way on<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_229"></a>[229]</span>
his stomach towards the upper side of the coffer
dam. Miguel was working on the lower side
and Bob knew that the dam was sufficiently
high to keep his actions hidden from the Mexican.</p>

<p>When he reached the edge of the river Bob
slipped into the water with as little noise as
possible. Keeping close to the dam he found
that he could make fair headway by half swimming
and half walking along the slanting boards
which held the Rio Grande in check. His plan
was desperate, yet it was the only one that
seemed feasible. Miguel would probably set
a rather long fuse, one long enough to allow
him to get safely away. &#8220;If I can only get
there before the fuse has burned to the first
stick of dynamite!&#8221; gasped Bob to himself.</p>

<p>Panting, struggling, gasping, he fought on.
His mind was filled with the horror of what
would happen should he be too late. There
was no way of telling how far Miguel had gone.
The dam that kept him hidden from the Mexican,
also hid the Mexican from him. He must&mdash;he
<i>must</i> go on until he was well past the center
of the dam&mdash;Miguel would do the job thoroughly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_230"></a>[230]</span>
if at all. Once there he must go through
a fresh ordeal. He must climb out of the
water and look over the edge of the dam in order
to get his bearings and to find out where the
Mexican had lit the fuse. Should he look over at
the wrong spot and Miguel see him, it was the
end&mdash;the end probably of his life and surely
the finish of the coffer dam.</p>

<p>At last he passed the sluice gates which
marked the center of the dam. A few rods
further on he knew he must climb up and look
over.</p>

<p>There was no time in which to gather his
nerves together. He must act and act at once.
So, pulling himself up with as little noise as
possible, he peered over. No Miguel was in
sight. But a hundred feet down the dam was
a tiny thread of white smoke shining gray in
the moonlight. With a despairing sob he
leaped towards it as fast as his soaked clothes
would let him.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/illus235.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p class="caption">Under his feet he saw the snake-like line of fuse.<br />
With a leap he pulled the whole thing over the bank.</p>

<p>Zing! A sharp report and a whistle through
the air by his ear told him that Miguel had
caught sight of him and hoped to stop him by
means of a bullet. But Bob had to go on. Again<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_231"></a>[231]</span>
came a shot, but this time farther from him.
&#8220;Rotten shooting!&#8221; panted Bob for the wind
to hear. Now he was almost at his goal. He
saw that there was still a length of fuse to be
burned before it got to the explosive but the
smoke was moving rapidly towards him. Another
bullet came. He would not have time to
get to the end of the fuse before it exploded.
Despairing, he was almost ready to give up.</p>

<p>Then under his feet he saw the snake-like
line of fuse. Reaching down, he grabbed it.
It was necessary to take the chance that this
sudden disturbance of the dynamite might set
it off. With a leap, he pulled the whole thing
over the bank with him and dropped with it
into the water of the Rio Grande. He did not
hear the sizzling sound that told that the fuse
was dead. As he sank into the water, Bob was
only conscious that he had done his best.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak"><small>CHAPTER XVIII</small><br />


THE RAIDERS RAIDED</h2>
</div>

<p>When he came to the surface, Bob&#8217;s first sensation
was one of extreme weariness. So spent
was he that it was all he could do to keep himself
afloat. The possibility of another shot
from Miguel did not spur him to dodging in the
water. If the shot was to come, it would. Bob
knew that he was alive, therefore the danger
which threatened the dam was over. This being
the case, a great contentment came to him&mdash;what
could happen to him now mattered very
little.</p>

<p>But as the minutes passed he got back his
grasp on things and realized that no more shots
were coming. Evidently the Mexican had become
frightened and had run. The next thing
he knew was that he was being pulled out of
the water by Feather-in-the-Wind.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hurt?&#8221; said the Indian.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_233"></a>[233]</span>&#8220;No,&#8221; Bob gasped. &#8220;Mig&mdash;Miguel got
away!&#8221;</p>

<p>The redskin did not seem to bother about the
Mexican&#8217;s escape. From the gentle way in
which he handled the boy, it was clear that
he was proud of him, proud that the young
white man had done such a brave deed. He had
seen what had happened as he came running
back from the camp.</p>

<p>&#8220;No matter,&#8221; he said. &#8220;You save dam. I
see. Good work.&#8221;</p>

<p>The praise acted like a tonic on the weary
boy. He stood up.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;d better hurry back,&#8221; he said, &#8220;and
send someone after the Greaser. He&#8217;s dangerous.&#8221;
And without further words the two set
forth.</p>

<p>Under the moon the town lay quiet, only a
lighted window here and there to tell that it
was inhabited. Around the machinery and on
the dam itself tiny shadows moved to show
that the watchmen were not sleeping. Just
before they reached the Quarter-house, a horse
and rider galloped up the hill. Bob recognized
Jenkins and stopped him.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_234"></a>[234]</span>&#8220;Did you get your men?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They dusted &#8217;fore I got there,&#8221; was the
disgusted answer. &#8220;I trailed &#8217;em down stream
but I reckon they&#8217;ve hit the border by now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sorry,&#8221; sympathized Bob, &#8220;but I guess they
found I&#8217;d got out and that scared &#8217;em.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I reckon so, &#8217;cause they had too good a start
for me to catch up with &#8217;em. Good night to ye,&#8221;
he finished and galloped off to put his tired
horse away and get some much-needed rest for
himself.</p>

<p>&#8220;Too bad,&#8221; grunted the Indian as they walked
on. &#8220;But you no tell him &#8217;bout Miguel. Why
not?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think I&#8217;d better report to Big Boss first.
Perhaps he will have some other plan.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Boss Whitney not here,&#8221; stated the Indian.
&#8220;Boss Taylor good man but not like Chief.
You wait for him. Now I go send one, two my
young men trail Miguel. Perhaps they catch
him&mdash;Jenkins, he never catch him. He tired.
Not much good trail nohow.&#8221;</p>

<p>This sounded like good advice to Bob.</p>

<p>&#8220;Go ahead,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I&#8217;d like to see Miguel
well punished.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_235"></a>[235]</span>The Indian stalked swiftly away and Bob
turned towards his boarding house and sleep.
It seemed a safe bet that there would be no
further trouble that night. In all probability
if an uprising amongst the Mexican laborers
had been planned it would not come off to-night.
Bob was sure that the blowing up of the dam
would have been the signal for the starting
of general hostilities. Since he had been able
to prevent the signal being given, and at the
same time had scared Miguel off, the chances
were that all would remain quiet. Leaderless,
the Mexicans were harmless, and Bob had a
hunch that Miguel was the only one of them
who was strong enough to direct the revolt.</p>

<p>But a surprise awaited him when he pushed
open the door of his room. Seated on the bed
was Ted Hoyt, who showed signs of having
anxiously awaited him.</p>

<p>&#8220;At last! I thought you&#8217;d never show up.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the rush?&#8221; asked Bob. &#8220;Found
out something?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You bet I have. A whole heap. Bet it&#8217;ll
make your hair curl&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Come on, Ted, old scout, out with it,&#8221;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_236"></a>[236]</span>
Bob urged the excited boy. &#8220;You haven&#8217;t
said anything yet. You&#8217;ve tuned up, now play
something!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&mdash;I think a bunch of Greasers are goin&#8217;
to raid the dam!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What?&#8221; Bob exploded. &#8220;Mexicans from
the other side of the border?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I think so. Reg&#8217;lar bandits&mdash;about
fifty of &#8217;em.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How do you know?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I saw &#8217;em. Dad sent me out &#8217;bout sundown
to hunt a stray calf and I saw some smoke
coming from a draw where nobody had any
business being. I hitched my nag and crawled
up until I could see.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And what did you see?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A bunch of armed Mexicans! They had
camped for supper. I figgered that they were
coming on up here to-night, so I beat it straight
for you. Bet Dad&#8217;s got a search party out
huntin&#8217; me right now!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Gee whiz, but we&#8217;ll have to get busy in a
hurry,&#8221; snapped Bob. &#8220;Come on, we&#8217;ll wake
Mr. Taylor.&#8221;</p>

<p>He had turned towards the door as he was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_237"></a>[237]</span>
speaking and the words died in his throat as
the door flew open and a dusty form stepped
into the lighted room.</p>

<p>It was Jerry King!</p>

<p>&#8220;You?&#8221; gasped Bob. &#8220;You? What are
you doing here? To tell us that the dirty work
you started is successful?&#8221;</p>

<p>The boy stood straight under the taunts
his former friend heaped upon him. A little
smile was at the corner of his mouth as he
answered.</p>

<p>&#8220;You haven&#8217;t much faith in me, have you?
You are quite ready to believe that I have been
a traitor to the Service.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But&mdash;but you are!&#8221; stammered Bob, taken
aback for a moment by Jerry&#8217;s words. &#8220;Didn&#8217;t
you admit it&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Whatever I am, we haven&#8217;t got time to gas
about it now. I came to&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t care what you came for,&#8221; flashed
Bob. &#8220;Don&#8217;t try to sell out the other side
now! It&#8217;s bad enough as it is without your
double-crossing your new friends!&#8221;</p>

<p>For a long moment both boys eyed each other
without flinching. Then in a flash Bob&#8217;s anger<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_238"></a>[238]</span>
fled and he thought clearly. Jerry must not
be let out to do more damage. He was too
dangerous. He must be caught and put away
until the crisis was over. No sooner had the
thought flashed through his mind than he acted.
Jerry was nearest the door, which was still
open, so a leaping tackle was the only thing
that would work.</p>

<p>Bob dived at his former chum with all his
force. They grappled.</p>

<p>&#8220;At him, Ted! We&#8217;ve got to keep him!&#8221; he
panted as he struggled with his adversary.</p>

<p>Ted was so amazed by the sudden happening
that he could not make his muscles respond to
the call immediately. When he did get started
it was too late, for Jerry had got an arm free
and had swung his fist to Bob&#8217;s jaw. The blow,
while it did not knock the Eastern boy out, was
sufficient to loosen his grasp and Jerry jerked
away and flashed out of the room.</p>

<p>Ted went after him on a run but again he
was too late, for when he reached the threshhold
of the house, his quarry had disappeared.
Dashing back through the hall, he met Bob
on his way out, and they went to the door.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_239"></a>[239]</span>&#8220;Lost him,&#8221; reported Ted. &#8220;Clumsy fool I
am!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t worry,&#8221; returned Bob. &#8220;I ought
to have been able to hold him. I&#8217;m only worried
about what he might do now. I&#8217;m going to
wake Mr. Taylor.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No good do that,&#8221; a quiet voice came to
them from right beside them in the shadow of
the doorway.</p>

<p>&#8220;Feather-in-the-Wind!&#8221; gasped Bob. &#8220;You
back?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I go myself trail Miguel. I catch his track
and run swiftly. Big moon help much. Pretty
soon I see little light just below big dam in
bushes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Was it&mdash;was it some strange Mexicans?&#8221;
asked Ted excitedly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. All got guns. Horses too. Bad men.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Your bandits!&#8221; whispered Bob to Ted. The
other boy nodded an assent. &#8220;Go on,&#8221; he urged
the Indian.</p>

<p>&#8220;I crawl up. Much big talk. Miguel talk
much. Think want Greasers start trouble.
Greaser leader say no start trouble till Miguel
get Greasers here start trouble too. Pretty soon<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_240"></a>[240]</span>
Miguel he start back towards camp. But much
afraid you tell &#8217;bout dynamite dam and people
watch for him. He go slow. I run behind.
Catch&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You killed him?&#8221;</p>

<p>The Indian came as near to chuckling as he
was able.</p>

<p>&#8220;No kill. Tie, gag, throw in bushes. Him
no more trouble to-night. Then come here get
you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Fine work!&#8221; was Bob&#8217;s comment. &#8220;Gives
us time to turn around.&#8221; Then he suddenly
remembered that the Indian had started the
talk by advising against bringing Mr. Taylor
into the emergency. &#8220;But why not get Boss
Taylor?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No use. He just rouse camp. Everything
mixed up. Got better plan.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What is it?&#8221; urged the boys.</p>

<p>&#8220;Plenty young men my tribe. Got five&mdash;six
guns. Plenty make much noise.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I see,&#8221; cried Bob joyously. &#8220;We&#8217;ll take &#8217;em
and surround the Greasers. Then shoot off the
guns and scare &#8217;em off! That it?&#8221;</p>

<p>The Indian grunted and without a word led<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_241"></a>[241]</span>
the way towards his camp. Bob rushed back
to the house and caught up a revolver that he
had bought to take care of any snakes that he
might meet on his jaunts away from the dam.
He did not catch up with Feather-in-the-Wind
and Ted until they had reached the Indian
encampment. The redskin was already rousing
the braves he had picked to take part in the
adventure, and there was nothing for the boys
to do until all the arrangements had been made.</p>

<p>Bob wondered what had become of Jerry.
Could he have gone to warn the bandits? It
seemed the most likely thing, yet there was
just a chance that as the plot had become so
mixed up by Miguel&#8217;s failure to pull off the
mining of the coffer dam, that Jerry would be
busy in another direction. He might have
decided to go and tell the cattlemen that a
serious hitch had occurred. It was all very
puzzling, especially Jerry&#8217;s sudden appearance in
their room.</p>

<p>This started a new train of thought. Why
had Jerry been foolish enough to show himself
in the Quarter-house? Nothing could be gained
by it. Could it be that he had come to warn<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_242"></a>[242]</span>
Bob of the impending danger to the dam and
consequently to himself? Perhaps the memory
of the dangers they had shared and overcome
in the Labyrinth had stirred him to a moment
of remorse and a desire to see his chum safe.
This seemed the most likely explanation but
further thought was impossible, for Feather-in-the-Wind
was ready to start.</p>

<p>The Apache chief had sent his braves ahead,
telling them to go separately to the point he mentioned
and not to do more until he gave the
signal. Therefore, only the two boys were left
to go with him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s go down by the Mexican bunkhouses
and see if anything is stirring there,&#8221; suggested
Ted Hoyt. &#8220;It&#8217;s on our way and just
the three of us won&#8217;t attract much attention.&#8221;</p>

<p>They picked their way through the sleeping
village, which was now dark as the moon had
long since finished its journey across the sky.
All seemed quiet in the Mexican houses, but
when they got up close a figure slipped from a
shadow and challenged them.</p>

<p>&#8220;No further this way!&#8221; the order came in
quiet yet determined English. Bob recognized<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_243"></a>[243]</span>
in the speaker one of the extra watchmen Boss
Taylor had put on.</p>

<p>&#8220;Right,&#8221; answered the boy and the trio moved
on, only to be stopped again a hundred feet
further on and the same order passed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Gee whiz!&#8221; Bob exclaimed. &#8220;Guess Taylor
has gotten wise and stuck a bunch around here
to sit on the Mexicans if they start anything.
Didn&#8217;t think he had it in him!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That will help us a heap,&#8221; was Ted&#8217;s idea.
&#8220;We won&#8217;t have to worry about their taking
a hand in our game!&#8221;</p>

<p>Feather-in-the-Wind only grunted and led
the way swiftly towards the place where he
had come on the Mexican bandits. The dark
seemed to bother him little, if at all, for he
walked with long strides, missing obstructions
as if by intuition. The boys had difficulty in
keeping up with him and it was a relief to them
when he finally slowed down and stopped. Telling
them by gestures to use the greatest caution
against making a noise, on he went, the boys
following.</p>

<p>They had crossed the river and were going
down stream. Here there was a gentle rise in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_244"></a>[244]</span>
the ground. About halfway to the top of this
hill the Indian motioned them to stay where
they were and then, taking their obedience for
granted, dropped on hands and knees and
started to crawl rapidly the remainder of the
way.</p>

<p>The excitement was too much for Bob. To
stay still while serious events might be happening
was not what he had bargained for and as
soon as Feather-in-the-Wind was out of sight
in the underbrush, he too started off, using the
same manner of locomotion.</p>

<p>So cleverly had Feather-in-the-Wind secreted
himself at the top of the rise that Bob was
about to crawl over him, thinking it was a
fallen log that obstructed his path. Stifling
an exclamation, he lay still. The Indian did not
show any signs of annoyance that his orders
had been disobeyed and when he started to
wriggle into a position from which he could see
the other side of the hill, by a move of the hand
he invited the boy to follow.</p>

<p>At first glance there seemed nothing amiss.
To Bob&#8217;s untrained eye, the shadows that lay
heavily in the dark of the night were only scrub<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_245"></a>[245]</span>
pine and underbrush. But as he looked these
shadows took form and substance. They were
men, sitting or lying relaxed, in attitudes of
waiting. A faint nicker and trampling of hoofs
told that horses were hobbled in the vicinity.</p>

<p>Bob heard a crunching noise behind him and
turned his head to find that Ted Hoyt too had
been unable to stand the strain of waiting
uncertain as to what was happening to his
friends.</p>

<p>Suddenly the still and silent air was rent by
a noise that has no equal in the world. It
was the blood-curdling war whoop of an Indian.
Coming so close to their ears, although they
had been expecting it, the boys nearly jumped
out of their skins with terror.</p>

<p>Feather-in-the-Wind had given the signal
to his men. A moment later answering whoops
seemed to come from all parts of the compass
and these were emphasized by a rattle of rifle
shots.</p>

<p>Bob jumped to his feet and began pulling the
trigger of his revolver as fast as his fingers
would work. Then, yelling, he followed Ted
and the Apache in the rush down the hillside.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_246"></a>[246]</span>The Mexicans, surprised by the suddenness
of the attack, did not wait to fire many shots
in return. A mad scramble for their horses
was taking place and dimly Bob saw the outlines
of the marauders string out at a mad
gallop.</p>

<p>When on a dead run he reached the foot of
the hill, all the Mexicans had gone, fleeing from
what they supposed was a trap.</p>

<p>Feather-in-the-Wind had become separated
from them, but his plan had worked! This was
Bob&#8217;s first thought, but his exultation was cut
short by the most surprising event of this
eventful night!</p>

<p>The clear notes of a bugle rang forth in
the thrilling signal to charge!</p>

JERRY COMES BACK</h2>
</div>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s that?&#8221; cried Ted Hoyt, stopping in
his stride.</p>

<p>&#8220;Blest if I know,&#8221; panted Bob. &#8220;But come
on, we can see from the hill over there!&#8221; and
with this he started off again. When they
reached the place Bob had thought would be a
point of vantage, the mystery was explained.</p>

<p>&#8220;Soldiers!&#8221; Bob gasped as the outlines of the
men grew clear against the star-lit sky as they
topped a near-by ridge. &#8220;Cavalry!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You sure?&#8221; demanded Ted. &#8220;I wonder
how in thunder they drifted into this here party.
I figgered it was all ours.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know, but I am sure glad they&#8217;re
here. Maybe they&#8217;ll catch those devils and then
we won&#8217;t ever have any more trouble with &#8217;em.
But&mdash;listen!&#8221;</p>

<p>From a distance came the rattle of gunshots.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_248"></a>[248]</span>&#8220;The Greasers making a stand, I reckon,&#8221;
was Ted Hoyt&#8217;s comment. &#8220;Probably a regular
battle.&#8221;</p>

<p>Bob was about to reply when an interruption
stopped the words that were on the end of his
tongue. A crackling noise in the bushes had
been the only warning Feather-in-the-Wind had
given of his approach. But his companion was
what surprised Bob.</p>

<p>Jerry again! Jerry, on whom the Indian was
keeping a firm grip.</p>

<p>&#8220;I catch him. Not catch any other&mdash;Mexican.&#8221;
The way the Indian said the last word
showed the contempt he felt for the boy who had
sold out his friends.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good! We&#8217;ll keep him until Boss Whitney
can attend to his case.&#8221; Bob rather expected
Jerry to say something, but as there was no
sound from him, he continued:</p>

<p>&#8220;I think we&#8217;d better go back to camp. The
shooting over there sounds as if our part of
the job is over. Think so?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ugh!&#8221; grunted Feather-in-the-Wind, by
way of saying yes. So, still keeping his hold
on Jerry, he led the way back to the Townsite.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_249"></a>[249]</span>
As they marched, Bob suddenly realized that
after the first yell and charge from the Indians
he had not heard or seen anything of them.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where are your young men?&#8221; he demanded
of the Indian.</p>

<p>&#8220;I send &#8217;em back. Watch Mexican house.
Mebbeso white men need help. All can do was
scare Mexican. No got guns &#8217;nough make fight.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No need to bother about the Greasers in
camp. They won&#8217;t make any trouble.&#8221; It was
the first word spoken by their captive.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why?&#8221; flashed Bob, quick to take advantage
of Jerry&#8217;s loosened lips.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll tell Mr. Whitney and no one else,&#8221; was
the defiant answer. Jerry&#8217;s first remark had
evidently been surprised out of him and now
he was again in control of himself.</p>

<p>No amount of urging or surprise questions
sufficed to break his silence and the little party
came to the lower camp before he had opened
his lips.</p>

<p>The place was in great confusion. The shooting,
first of the Indians and then of the soldiers,
had thoroughly waked up the town. The center
of the activity seemed to be around the Mexican<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_250"></a>[250]</span>
camp and when they reached the outskirts of
the crowd that was jostling together in the
street, they realized that the Mexicans were
trapped, that if they had been unwise enough
to start something they were outnumbered
three to one. Here and there were Feather-in-the-Wind&#8217;s
braves, ready for any emergency.</p>

<p>The bunkhouses seemed deserted. If there
were any Mexicans inside they were doing their
best to play dead. The crowd seemed to think
that the laborers were the ones who had started
the trouble and they were shouting, daring the
Greasers to come out and start something. But
there was no answer from the inside.</p>

<p>Just as the crowd was growing weary, the
roar of a high powered gasoline engine drowned
out the noise they were making. With the muffler
cut out open and the exhaust snapping
explosions like the reports of young cannon, a
car dashed down the street and stopped with a
jerk. Out of it hopped Big Boss Whitney.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the rumpus?&#8221; he roared. &#8220;What&#8217;s
broken loose?&#8221;</p>

<p>His presence dominated the crowd and for
a moment there was comparative quiet. Then<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_251"></a>[251]</span>
everybody tried to explain at the same time and
only succeeded in confusing the man more. His
eye, darting through the crowd, fell on Bob and
the others. &#8220;Here, Hazard,&#8221; he called, &#8220;tell
me quick what&#8217;s up!&#8221;</p>

<p>In a few words Bob sketched the happenings
of the past few hours. When he finished by
saying that the cavalry had arrived on the scene
and had started chasing the Mexicans, the Chief
breathed a sigh of relief.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s all right then,&#8221; he muttered and stood
up to reassure the crowd.</p>

<p>&#8220;All over, men. There&#8217;ll be no more trouble
to-night. Our Mexicans are not mixed up in
this yet and the soldiers have come to see that
they don&#8217;t. They&#8217;ll be here any minute now!&#8221;</p>

<p>This satisfied the excited mob and gradually it
thinned out as Whitney demanded more details
from Bob.</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you send me that wire to get up here
as quickly as I could? It caught me at Las
Cruces just by chance.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; returned the boy. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t have time
after things started to break loose.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wonder who did then. But I want to go<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_252"></a>[252]</span>
to the troops. Which way did they go?&#8221; But
before Bob could answer, Mr. Whitney saw for
the first time that Jerry was being held prisoner
by the Indian.</p>

<p>&#8220;But what does this mean?&#8221; he exclaimed.
&#8220;What are you holding onto King for?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He has been the go-between for the cattlemen
and the Greasers,&#8221; said Bob bitterly, sick
that it was his job to tell of his former chum&#8217;s
treachery. &#8220;We&#8217;ve caught him, that&#8217;s all!
When we&#8217;ve time I&#8217;ll tell you the whole rotten
thing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Haven&#8217;t you anything to say for yourself?&#8221;
snapped the man. &#8220;Is Bob right?&#8221;</p>

<p>Jerry looked at the chief steadily and was
about to reply when a yell came to their ears.</p>

<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re coming!&#8221;</p>

<p>Before there was time to figure out who it
was that was coming, the hoofbeats and jangling
of accouterments foretold the approach of the
troopers. A moment later the soldiers trotted
down the street under the electric lights that
had been turned on when the trouble started.
In their midst were a number of sullen looking
Mexicans, evidently prisoners.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_253"></a>[253]</span>Mr. Whitney stepped out and halted the
troop by hailing the captain, who was in the lead.
Tom noticed to his surprise that at the officer&#8217;s
side was Link O&#8217;Day, whom he had met as
the foreman of Thaddeus Holman&#8217;s ranch.
What his appearance on the scene meant was
more than the boy could imagine.</p>

<p>The officer halted his men and after a brief
talk with Mr. Whitney gave some orders to his
lieutenant. The Chief then turned to Bob.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re going to my shack to talk this out.
Come along. I want Feather-in-the-Wind and
Jerry too. Hoyt, find Mr. Taylor and ask him
to report to me at once!&#8221;</p>

<p>Link O&#8217;Day walked with the two men in the
lead and all the way to the house Bob racked his
brain to find a reason for this man&#8217;s having
ridden into camp with the soldiers and on top
of that to be included in the conference the
Chief had arranged.</p>

<p>The porch of the cottage was the spot chosen
for the talk. When Taylor joined the group
Mr. Whitney opened the proceedings.</p>

<p>&#8220;With your permission, Captain Wendell, I
would like to get the whole sequence of events<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_254"></a>[254]</span>
in order. You have told me that you have
captured the better part of the gang of raiders,
so I will ask Bob Hazard to tell me what led
up to your timely intervention. Is that all right?
Hazard was in the midst of explaining the situation
when you rode in, and I&#8217;d like to hear the
finish of his yarn.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Let him shoot!&#8221; was the answer.</p>

<p>&#8220;All right then, Bob,&#8221; encouraged Mr. Whitney.
&#8220;Start from the beginning and tell us
everything that&#8217;s happened.&#8221;</p>

<p>So many days had passed during which Bob&#8217;s
one desire had been to unload his troubles on
his Chief that he was not at all embarrassed
when he found he had to tell his tale before so
many witnesses. He started in and until he
reached the episode of Miguel&#8217;s attempt to blow
up the coffer dam he spoke steadily and clearly.
At this point, however, when it was necessary
to tell of the part he had taken in the adventure,
he began to stammer and hesitate.
Feather-in-the-Wind broke in to help him out
and in his short, broken sentences vividly pictured
for the listeners the plucky deed that
had been done to save the dam.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_255"></a>[255]</span>When he finished a ripple of admiration
passed around the group, and to cover his embarrassment,
Bob hurriedly went on to tell of
Jerry&#8217;s visit and the surprise attack planned by
Feather-in-the-Wind.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the story, Mr. Whitney,&#8221; he finished.
&#8220;And as the dam is safe, everything seems to
be all right only, only&mdash;&#8221; Here the boy&#8217;s voice
broke&mdash;&#8220;the part about Jerry. I&mdash;I can&#8217;t
understand how he could do it&mdash;how&mdash;how he
could be a traitor to the Service&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can tell you!&#8221; the statement rang out from
a corner of the porch. Bob looked around to
find that it was Link O&#8217;Day who had cried
out. &#8220;You can&#8217;t understand because Jerry is
not a traitor!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What?&#8221; exclaimed Bob, amazed.</p>

<p>&#8220;What?&#8221; echoed Mr. Whitney, who had
decided as he listened to Bob&#8217;s story that the
evidence against Jerry was sufficient to prove
his guilt.</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; laughed the man. &#8220;I&#8217;m quite serious.
Even in spite of all appearances the boy is quite
innocent of the charge. Am I right, Captain
Wendell?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_256"></a>[256]</span>&#8220;You are!&#8221; returned the soldier. &#8220;Besides,
I think he is very much to be commended.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Please, please explain,&#8221; Bob implored. &#8220;I
want to believe in him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; Whitney said quickly, &#8220;the sooner
any stain is removed from a member of the
Service the better. We are not used to
traitors!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, then, it&#8217;s just this. Jerry was the first
one of all of you to smell trouble brewing. He
had been coming up to the ranch and had heard
the rather good-natured grumbling that passed
between all of us about the damage the dam
would do to our particular kind of business.
Then when Harper and Wesley&mdash;the men
Hazard has told you about&mdash;began to talk
seriously to him he decided that it would be
best if he did some &#8216;secret service&#8217; work by
seeming to fall in with their plans&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Here Bob caused a sudden halt in the proceedings.
Rushing over to Jerry he held out
his hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;Jerry, Jerry, old scout! I&#8217;m sorry as I can
be. Forgive me for not having faith in you.
I wanted to all the time!&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_257"></a>[257]</span>The other boy&#8217;s response was quick and
generous.</p>

<p>&#8220;I understood, Bob, how you felt. That is,
all but once or twice when&mdash;Oh, but what&#8217;s
the use? Of course I forgive you!&#8221; When
they had shaken hands warmly the conference
had a chance to proceed. O&#8217;Day took up the
narrative where he had left off.</p>

<p>&#8220;Jerry got into the confidence of the cowmen
principally because they needed him as a go-between
and it was not until after he had all
his plans laid that I got into the game.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Link got onto me all right,&#8221; put in Jerry.
&#8220;He started jawing me one day about playing
poker and before he got through I&#8217;d told him
all about it. I <i>hate</i> playing cards and the only
reason I did it at all was to make Wesley and
Harper believe that they had me thrown and
tied. I&#8217;m glad you did get on, though, Link,
because I was getting tired of playing the big
game alone.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;After that,&#8221; continued O&#8217;Day, &#8220;we held
councils of war and decided that it would be
best if we could nip the big plot in the bud
without letting you fellows at the dam get wise.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_258"></a>[258]</span>&#8220;What was the scheme the cattlemen had
decided upon?&#8221; Whitney wanted to know.</p>

<p>&#8220;To blow up as much of the works as
possible. Have a raid by border Mexicans take
place simultaneously with a revolt by the
laborers.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And are all the ranchers in on this?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;By no means. Comparatively few. Thad
Holman never knew a thing about it. They were
mostly dissatisfied cowboys and unsuccessful
squatters who saw profit for themselves in a
war with Mexico.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m mighty glad of that,&#8221; said Whitney.
&#8220;But go on; I won&#8217;t interrupt any more.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, the signal for the trouble to start was
to be the blowing up of the cofferdam but it
was slated to take place <i>to-morrow</i> night
instead of to-night. The bandits have been on
this side of the border for several days, so the
speeding up of the plan did not interfere with
<i>them</i>. What it did interfere with, however,
was the plans Jerry and I had laid to stop the
plot&#8217;s being carried out. You, Hazard,&#8221; O&#8217;Day
smiled and pointed him out, &#8220;you were
responsible for our troubles.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_259"></a>[259]</span>&#8220;How?&#8221; Bob wanted to know.</p>

<p>&#8220;By coming up to the ranch and exciting the
cowboys&#8217; suspicions. They made Jerry come
with them to overtake you as you went home.
If you had not flared up, probably they would
have let you go on home, but as it was you
gave them no choice but to hold you up. Then
when you got away they feared you knew more
than was healthy. As they fled they got in
touch with the bandit chief and started the ball
rolling a day earlier than had been planned.
Jerry got wind of it from Miguel only late
to-day. There was just a chance that he could
ride to Fort Cummings in time to get Captain
Wendell and his troop here. First, however, he
sent that telegram to you, Mr. Whitney.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thanks, Jerry,&#8221; Whitney said seriously.
Bob happened to look around and missed
Feather-in-the-Wind from the group.</p>

<p>&#8220;Captain Wendell already had promised to
be on hand for to-morrow night. It was by
his help that we expected to hold the lid on.
But to get back to Jerry: He had desperate
little time to get to the Fort and bring the
soldiers back. It was a wonderful ride, but<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_260"></a>[260]</span>
he made it. I only joined the troop on the
trail. Jerry had ridden ahead to stop Miguel
from blowing up the cofferdam.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And I was too late,&#8221; put in the boy. &#8220;Bob
had beaten me to it. I was sure some glad when
I found the old wall was safe. It was the thing
I feared most as I rode for the soldiers&mdash;that
Miguel would give the signal before I could
get back. I sort of had a hunch that it was
Bob who had had a hand in it and I went to
his room to tell him I was on his side. But
you wouldn&#8217;t let me, Bob,&#8221; he finished.</p>

<p>&#8220;I know, Jerry, and I&#8217;m sorry.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Anyway,&#8221; Jerry went on, &#8220;when you chased
me out I beat it for the spot I&#8217;d agreed to meet
Captain Wendell and guide him to the Mexicans&#8217;
hiding place. That is, after I&#8217;d attended
to something&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And that was&mdash;?&#8221; suggested Mr. Whitney.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I went to the Mexican bunkhouses and
told Miguel&#8217;s bunch that he&#8217;d sent me to tell
&#8217;em to meet him somewheres up the river. I
sent &#8217;em just as far away as I could from the
place trouble was likely to happen without
letting &#8217;em get suspicious. They slipped out one<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_261"></a>[261]</span>
at a time before you doubled the guards, Mr.
Taylor,&#8221; he finished with a smile.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then that was what you meant when you
told us that the laborers wouldn&#8217;t be any
bother, was it?&#8221; asked Bob.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. All the men that were left were
harmless. But as soon as I had given the word,
I was off to meet the captain. I thought he and
his bunch would never show up.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But when we did come it was our turn to
be disappointed.&#8221; Here the cavalry officer took
up the story. &#8220;Bob Hazard and his friends
had got ahead of us too.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry,&#8221; began the boy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t be for a minute,&#8221; said Captain Wendell.
&#8220;It was an excellent piece of strategy
and quite successful. I&#8217;ll admit, though, that
it was startling to hear the old Apache war
whoop come so suddenly from the darkness.
Besides that, it forced us to chase our quarry
rather than slip up and surround it. But you
couldn&#8217;t know that, of course, and as we captured
most of the band no harm was done.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But what happened to the rest? Did they
get away?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_262"></a>[262]</span>&#8220;Yes, for the most part, as their horses were
fresher. While we were rounding up the stragglers,
the others were so far ahead I didn&#8217;t think
it worth while pursuing them further. But
we&#8217;ve got enough to make an example of. It&#8217;s
been a good night&#8217;s work.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It certainly has,&#8221; said Mr. Whitney, &#8220;and
it seems to me that my thanks are due to everybody.
I was away endeavoring to arrange for
a detachment of troops to come here and protect
the project from just what was about to happen.
The trouble at Columbus mixed things up so
that they could not give me any definite promise
and I thought it best to stick around until I
knew what could be expected. I believed that
nothing could happen up here so quickly&mdash;it
was my mistake. But you chaps have made it
all right for me. I want to thank you all!&#8221;</p>

<p>The group was a little uncomfortable under
the direct praise and welcomed the diversion
made by Feather-in-the-Wind&#8217;s rejoining them,
bringing with him a newcomer.</p>

<p>It was Miguel Philipe, who during the excitement
had been left lying bound in the bushes
where the Indian had dumped him. When he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_263"></a>[263]</span>
was brought under the light of the porch, he
was a sorry looking specimen. He had been
unable to defend himself from the insects and
his face was puffed and mottled and his eyes
almost closed.</p>

<p>&#8220;The poor beggar has sure been punished,&#8221;
said the soldier.</p>

<p>&#8220;You bet,&#8221; Jerry said quickly. &#8220;Don&#8217;t you
think he&#8217;s had enough, Boss Whitney?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps, but&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And I sort of led him on,&#8221; interrupted the
boy. &#8220;I&#8217;d like it a heap if you&#8217;d let him go.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Whitney was silent a minute as he
thought over Jerry&#8217;s plea for the captive.</p>

<p>&#8220;If I could be sure he wouldn&#8217;t do any more
harm&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He no more make trouble,&#8221; put in the Indian
gravely. &#8220;He scared too much. I take him
border. He no come back.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think he is right,&#8221; agreed Captain Wendell.
&#8220;Once he&#8217;s in Mexico it will be a long time
before he ever has nerve enough to slip back.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right then, Jerry,&#8221; was Mr. Whitney&#8217;s
decision. &#8220;I&#8217;ll leave it to you and Feather-in-the-Wind
to do with him as you like.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak"><small>CHAPTER XX</small><br />


THE FUTURE</h2>
</div>

<p>A few days later a detachment of infantry
arrived to relieve Captain Wendell and his men.
The new troop was to stay permanently, as the
troubles at the border were continuing and Mr.
Whitney had found it impracticable to get
laborers of any other nationality than Mexicans.</p>

<p>The bunch of Mexicans Jerry had sent off on
the wild goose chase the night of the raid came
straggling into camp during the early hours of
the morning, to find that a tight ring of guards
had been made around their section of the lower
camp. When they attempted to get through
they were put under arrest and during the day
were loaded on a train and shipped to the border
to be sent back into their native country. The
captured bandits were delivered to General
Pershing&#8217;s headquarters to await trial.</p>

<p>Bob and Jerry were happy. The companionship<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_265"></a>[265]</span>
which they had formed during the days of
the Labyrinth and which had been interrupted,
now was cemented still further. Ted Hoyt had
been allowed by his father to come back to the
dam and the trio had great times together.</p>

<p>On Sundays Bob&#8217;s and Jerry&#8217;s usual plan was
to go up to Thaddeus Holman&#8217;s ranch and spend
the day with Link O&#8217;Day, who had taken a
great fancy to Bob. Ted, of course, went home.
But Bob realized that the reason O&#8217;Day was
good to him was that he was Jerry&#8217;s friend.
There was something more than comradeship
between Jerry and the tall cattleman; it was
more the relation of a younger and elder
brother.</p>

<p>This had a good effect on Jerry. It was as if
he had found what he had told Bob in the
Labyrinth he most wanted&mdash;someone to belong
to, a family. He was becoming less serious, less
self-contained.</p>

<p>Link O&#8217;Day talked a lot about the Northwest
and especially of the lumbering. He seemed to
have a great love of forests. Jerry grew more
and more interested.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d like that,&#8221; he said one day as the trio<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_266"></a>[266]</span>
were loafing away the afternoon in the shade
of Holman&#8217;s bunkhouse, &#8220;and I think I&#8217;ll drift
up that way and tackle it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And leave the Service?&#8221; put in Bob. &#8220;I
don&#8217;t see how you could. It&#8217;s the finest&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We know how <i>you</i> feel!&#8221; Link O&#8217;Day
laughed. &#8220;According to you, Rockefeller hasn&#8217;t
anything on the youngest cub of an engineer so
long as the cub is one of the Reclamation
Service&#8217;s outfit. Therefore your opinion isn&#8217;t
worth anything in this case.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Seriously, Bob,&#8221; went on Jerry, &#8220;the Service
is good stuff, but I haven&#8217;t the same sort of
feeling about it that you have. Boss Whitney
is great to work for and&mdash;and all that, but
I&#8217;m not so sure that there isn&#8217;t something else
to do that I would like a heap better. This
forestry business, for instance. It listens good
to me. Big trees, the song of the band saws,
all the rest of it Link has been telling us about.
And if Link would only go along&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wouldn&#8217;t be surprised if I did,&#8221; said Link
with a smile. &#8220;I&#8217;m getting a little tired of cows
now. If you really want to go, Jerry, I&#8217;ll start
along with you any time.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_267"></a>[267]</span>&#8220;You will?&#8221; The boy was overjoyed.
&#8220;That&#8217;s great! You&#8217;d better begin getting your
stuff together &#8217;cause I&#8217;m going to call for you
just as soon as Boss Whitney will let me go.&#8221;</p>

<p>Bob made one last effort.</p>

<p>&#8220;But, Jerry, how about the Labyrinth? We
found it&mdash;don&#8217;t you want to have a hand in
what happens next?&#8221;</p>

<p>For a moment Jerry seemed to hesitate. Then
he answered:</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the only thing I&#8217;ll really be sorry
for&mdash;and leaving you, old man. But after all,
it was you who was responsible for the trip.
I just went because you dared me into it. No,
Bob, if Link will go North with me, I&#8217;ll have to
pass up the Labyrinth.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; said Bob laughing. &#8220;I reckon
you&#8217;re lost. I&#8217;m beat, but I sure hope you will
find that you picked the right thing for
yourself.&#8221;</p>

<p>The next day, when Jerry came to Mr. Whitney
to tell him of his decision, Bob was there.
The engineer listened to the boy and when he
had finished told him that he could leave when
it was most convenient.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_268"></a>[268]</span>&#8220;I&#8217;ve known for a long time, Jerry, that you
were not a born engineer like Bob Hazard here,
but you&#8217;ve been a good rodman and I hate to
lose you. Besides, I won&#8217;t soon forget what you
did for us in the Mexican mix-up. But everyone
must do what he thinks is best. Good luck
to you!&#8221;</p>

<p>After Jerry left, the work went on smoothly
and the main dam grew higher and higher each
day. Bob became proficient in the things Mr.
Whitney gave him to do and by the time summer
came near its close he felt that he had a good
foundation of practical engineering on which
to build the theoretical knowledge he would get
at college.</p>

<p>The Mexican situation was unchanged. The
United States had not gone into Mexico and
the cattlemen still grumbled but did no more
than that. The presence of the soldiers was
enough to keep the laborers in check.</p>

<p>For several weeks before the date Bob had
set as the time he must return to the East, he
had received no letters from his father. Just
as he was about to be a little worried, something
occurred which settled all his fears.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_269"></a>[269]</span>Coming back from the job one night, he saw
a strange yet familiar figure sitting on the porch
of the Quarter-house. When he got near
enough to see he started on the run towards the
building.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dad! Dad! But I&#8217;m glad to see you!&#8221; he
cried.</p>

<p>Unashamed, he put his arms around the man
when he dashed up on the veranda and asked
a multitude of questions.</p>

<p>Mr. Hazard had grown lonely for his son
and had come out to see him on the job and
to have the long ride homeward with him across
the continent.</p>

<p>&#8220;You see, son, I&#8217;ll lose you again right after
we get home.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why?&#8221; Bob wanted to know.</p>

<p>&#8220;Because Rensselaer Polytech opens a few
days after we get back.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve&mdash;you&#8217;ve fixed it for me to go
there?&#8221; said Bob, realizing that by letting him
go to that particular institution, where only
engineering was taught, his father had given up
all hope of his ever being a lawyer. &#8220;That&#8217;s
bully of you, Dad!&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_270"></a>[270]</span>&#8220;You said you wanted to go there,&#8221; was the
simple answer.</p>

<p>That night Mr. Hazard and Bob had dinner
with Mr. Whitney. The Chief told the boy&#8217;s
father all the things Bob had accomplished.</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s going to make a fine engineer, Mr.
Hazard. You&#8217;ll be proud of him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sure of that. I want to tell you now
how proud I am of the Reclamation Service
and the things it&#8217;s doing. I&#8217;ve looked the
Service up and I&#8217;ve been to one or two projects
that have been finished.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You have done that?&#8221; Bob said excitedly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; was the smiling answer, &#8220;and since
I have seen for myself, I&#8217;d rather Bob became
an engineer on this Service than anything else&mdash;excluding,
of course, a lawyer!&#8221;</p>

<p>During the day or two that remained before
Bob&#8217;s departure, Mr. Hazard was shown the
dam and all the things that made up its building.
Bob was busy saying good-bye to all the friends
he had made.</p>

<p>Feather-in-the-Wind, while preserving his customary
dignity, was genuinely sorry to see him
go.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_271"></a>[271]</span>&#8220;You will come back,&#8221; he said. &#8220;You have
smelt desert. You have helped build. You
come back. I know. Feather-in-the-Wind will
wait. Will be glad when you come. Adios!&#8221;</p>

<p>When at last Bob was seated in the automobile
ready to start for Engle and the train that
would carry him back to the East and college,
a great feeling of sadness swept over him. He
took a last look at the dam and the myriad
activities that clustered around it, and he was
sorry that he had to go.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come on back next summer,&#8221; cried Ted
Hoyt, who had been given a few minutes from
his work to bid his friend good-bye. &#8220;And
perhaps I&#8217;ll go East with you afterwards. My
father says he might let me if I&#8217;m still so loco
about it!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s great! I sure hope he does. I&#8217;ll be
back all right&mdash;that is, if you&#8217;ll have a place
for me,&#8221; Bob finished, speaking to Mr. Whitney
who had come up to the group.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t fret yourself about <i>that</i>, Bob. I&#8217;ll
have a job for you all right and one you&#8217;ll like,&#8221;
said the engineer.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is it?&#8221; demanded the boy.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_272"></a>[272]</span>&#8220;To go as my aide on an official survey of the
Labyrinth!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then the folks in Washington have told you
to go ahead on what Jerry and I reported?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They have. I just received the letter in the
last mail. I won&#8217;t be able to get away from here
until about the time your next vacation comes,
so it will work out just right. I can expect
you, can&#8217;t I?&#8221;</p>

<p>Bob Hazard gave a joyous assent. A moment
later the machine had started and the scene of
Bob&#8217;s first experience as an engineer was fading
into the distance. Ahead were the four years
of endeavor that would fit him to take his place
with Mr. Whitney as a full-fledged engineer of
the Service.</p>

<p>As the machine slipped over the hilltop hiding
the dam from sight, Bob turned his eyes to the
front. He was riding into the future, happy
and content.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you will have to check the laws of the country where
  you are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without

Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means

Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org 

Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary 
Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
